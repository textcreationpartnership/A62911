            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> And to his Worthy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort, Madam <hi>Tryphena Grove,</hi> Grace, Mercy, and Peace be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed from God our Father, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</head>
            <p>THE True God is ſtyled, <hi>The Excellency of Jacob,</hi> Amos <hi>8.7. The Glory and Praiſe of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95520:3"/>Iſa. <hi>60.19. Deut. 10.21.</hi> Though <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Egypt</hi> boaſted thus, <hi>I am the Son of the Wiſe, the Son of Ancient Kings,</hi> Iſaiah <hi>19.11.</hi> Yet <hi>David</hi> Glories in this, <hi>Lord, I am thy Servant, I am thy Servant, the Son of thy Handmaid,</hi> Pſal. <hi>116.16.</hi> This is your Honour, That you are deſcended of Parents that owned Chriſt's Goſpel, eſpouſed his Interest, and countenanced God's pure Worſhip in Dark, Difficult, and Dangerous Times: I Rejoyce that you tread in their ſteps, and endeavour to promote God's Kingdom in your Family, and among your Neighbours. As this hath been the Glory of your Predeceſſors, ſo I deſire it may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to, and be inherited by your Children, that the Entail of God's Covenant may never be cut off from your Poſterity. The World counts it Honourable when Eſtates continue, and Lands deſcend from one Generation to another. But this is most valuable,
<pb facs="tcp:95520:3"/>when Piety, and God's pure Worſhip deſcends from Father to Son. It is ſaid, <hi>Deut. 33.4. Moſes commanded us a Law, even the Inheritance of the Congregation of Jacob.</hi> As God hath commanded, and Commended his Law as an Inheritance to the whole Church, ſo every Particular Member of it ſhould by his Choice accept the Word of God as his Inheritance, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith he did, <hi>Pſal. 119.111. Thy Teſtimonies have I taken as my Heritage for ever, for they are the rejoycing of my Heart.</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren will be ſure to claim their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Lands, but it is much more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable to claim their Father's God, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did; <hi>Exod. 15.2. He is my Father's God, and I will exalt him.</hi> How Excellent is it, when they Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit their Parents Graces? <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfeigned Faith dwelt in his Grandmother <hi>Lois,</hi> then in his Mother <hi>Eunice,</hi> and then in <hi>Timothy</hi> himſelf. This is to be an
<pb facs="tcp:95520:4"/>Ancient Family, and truly Noble. As in the Temple of Old there were Treaſurers over the Dedicated Things, <hi>1 Chron. 20.26.</hi> So in the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Temple, the Church of Chriſt, God hath conſtituted Chriſtian Parents as the Treaſurers over the Dedicated Things. Children of Believers are Dedicated to God in Baptiſm, and Parents ſhould Carefully, and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully watch over theſe Holy Dedicated Things, that they may not be alienated from God by cold Neutrality, or open Profaneneſs and Degeneracy.</p>
            <p>The enſuing Diſcourſe Treats on two Noble Subjects, <hi>The Preaching of the Son of God,</hi> and <hi>The Priſon of God,</hi> which will be the certain Portion and Puniſhment of thoſe that reject the Word of the Son of God. I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of manifold Weakneſſes, Defects, and Imperfections in my ſelf, that
<pb facs="tcp:95520:4"/>might deter me from expoſing my ſelf to the Cenſures of a Cavilling Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Age; but becauſe my Life declines apace, my Days do poſt away, my Sun will quickly ſet, I am willing to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh ſomething that may contribute to the Informing the Ignorant, and awaken the Secure. Chriſt's Preaching may be a Load-ſtone to draw periſhing Sinners to him; and the Priſon of God may Alarm, and Rouze up drouſie Souls, and be a Spur <hi>to Quicken them to fly for Refuge, to lay hold of the Hope ſet before them.</hi> I bow my Knee to the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of Lights, and the God of all Grace, that he would Grant unto you the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wiſdom and Revelation, and thereby Seal Inſtruction to your Souls; that being built upon your most Holy Faith, you may grow up into Chriſt in all things, and at laſt obtain an Inheritance among all them that are
<pb facs="tcp:95520:5"/>ſanctified by Faith in Chriſt. Theſe are the unfeigned Deſires of</p>

                  <p>By which alſo he went, and Preached to the Spirits in Priſon.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN theſe words we may obſerve, 1. A Subject, He. The Perſon ſpoken of is called Chriſt in the 18th. Verſe, <hi>Though he was put to death in the Fleſh, yet he was quickned by the Spirit.</hi> He taſted Death for a little time, but ſoon aboliſhed and ſwallowed it up for ever. His Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature rendred him obnoxious to Death, but his Divine Nature made him Victorious over it. 2. We have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing affirmed and aſſerted of this Subject, <hi>viz.</hi> That he went by it, that is, by his Divine Nature, and preached. Though the Son of God had not yet aſſumed a Humane Nature, yet he did exiſt in his Divine Nature; though he came to Men in time, yet he was with the Father from
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95520:6"/>Eternity, and ſo was in a capacity to Preach before he was manifeſted in the Fleſh. As a Candle can ſhine and give Light before it is put into a Lanthorn; and the Light created the firſt day did Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate the World before the Sun was created the fourth day. So the Divine Nature of Chriſt did enlighten the World before he roſe, and appeared as a Sun of Righteouſneſs ſhining in and through a Body of Fleſh, while the fourth Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of Years was yet currant. And this Expreſſion is obſervable, that by his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature he went and preached. Where the Son of God preaches, thither he comes, and there he is Spiritually preſent; where the Goſpel is diſpenſed, there is a ſpecial Preſence of the Son of God. In <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.17. it is ſaid, <hi>He came and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Peace to thoſe that were far off, and to them that are nigh.</hi> So the Houſholder is ſaid to go forth to the elder Brother, and entreat him to come in to the Feaſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.28. Where the Word is preached, the Father and the Son do come forth, and draw near to Men, and treat with them about their Spiritual and Eternal Good.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We may obſerve to whom the Son of God preached; <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, it was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95520:6"/>to the Spirits in Priſon; but yet he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to them before they were caſt into Priſon, while they were yet ſeated in Bodies cloathed with Fleſh, and were dwelling in the World; it is ſuch that are meet to be preached to, that are yet in the way in a ſtate of Tryal, and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates for Eternity. When once the Final Sentence is paſſed, and the eternal ſtate of Sinners fixed, it is too late to ſet on foot a Treaty of Peace with them, or to make offers of Mercy to them. Thoſe that were Priſoners in the days of <hi>Peter,</hi> were living, and at Liberty in the days of <hi>Noah.</hi> The <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid. Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Teſt. and the Notes on it.</note> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts would impoſe and obtrude this ſenſe on <hi>Peter</hi>'s words, as if the Soul of Jeſus Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeparated from the Body, did go and Preach to ſome of the Fathers of the Old Teſtament, that were not (as they ſay) yet admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, but were reſerved in ſome out-rooms of Hell, where they felt no pain, but did not yet ſee the Glorious Face of God, nor enjoy his Bleſſed Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. But this cannot be the true ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine ſenſe of the words. For, 1. If Spirit ſignifies here the Soul of Chriſt, and quickned imports his Reſurrection,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95520:7"/>then Jeſus Chriſt muſt Preach to theſe Spirits not while his Body was dead, but after his Reſurrection, which the Papiſts themſelves will not own or admit. 2. Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the 18th. Verſe ſignifies Chriſt's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, and it was not in this, or by this that he preached to the Spirits of the Old Teſtament after their Souls were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from their Bodies. 3. Thoſe that Chriſt preached to lived, and were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient in the days of <hi>Noah;</hi> it is not ſaid, they did Repent of, or break off from their ſins, but were hardned in their Unbelief, and dyed in their Iniquities; they went down uncircumciſed in Heart into the Pit, and ſo Eternal Death was their Wages, and Hell was their own Place. Now even Papiſts dare not ſay, that Chriſt preached to the Damned, their ſtate is remedileſs, the Sentence irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, their Loſs irrecoverable; there is no Year of Jubilee, no Goal-delivery for impriſoned Spirits confined to, and ſhut up in Hell. Jeſus Chriſt would not Preach to thoſe that God had caſt off for ever, and doomed to Eternal Miſery, for their continued and obſtinate Diſobedience, they whoſe Nature was not changed on Earth, their Condition could not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in Hell. 4. If the Soul of Chriſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95520:7"/>had preached to Souls in the Priſon of Hell, what Reaſon can be aſſigned why he ſhould Preach rather to thoſe that were diſobedient in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> than to thoſe that were diſobedient in the days of <hi>Abraham, Moſes,</hi> or in the after-times of the Prophets? This one Argument may ſhame this Notion, and confute this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded Expoſition of the words, that the Soul of Chriſt went down to Hell to Preach to Spirits there.</p>
            <p>Before I come to the main Doctrines that the words afford, I ſhall obſerve ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other great Truths that the words do offer to us. 1. That the Scripture is a moſt Excellent and Divine Book, in that it gives us ſuch a true Account, and ſuch ſure Notions about a future and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtate after Death. As it tells us what is the Condition of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and all the Holy Prophets, that they are in the Palaces and Kingdom of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.28. ſo it informs us what is become of the Sinners of the Old World; that theſe are caſt into the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of God. He that appoints Portion in the Paradice above, and aſſigns places in the Priſon below, and adjudges to each of theſe by an irrevocable Sentence, can beſt tell what is become of Saints and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95520:8"/>Sinners now they are departed out of the World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Evidences the Immortality of the Soul, that the Spirits of wicked Men are ſaid to ſubſiſt after Death, and to abide in God's Priſon, though their Garments of Fleſh were pluckt off, their Houſes of Clay thrown down to the Duſt, yet their Souls did not expire, or ſleep; as a Man can live, though his Garments are put off, or his Houſe be demoliſhed, or drop down: So the Soul hath no ſuch neceſſary dependance on the Body, but can exiſt though this Garment be put off, this Houſe be pulled down. This Candle will burn, though taken out of the Lanthorn of the Fleſh, Death doth not blow out, only it removes this Light into another World.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We may obſerve the Mercy and Goodneſs of God, that though he had threatned a Flood, and adjudged all the World (beſides eight Perſons) to be drowned by it, yet the Son of God Preaches to this degenerate and wicked World before he deſtroys them; though God deſigned Severity againſt their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, yet he offers Mercy to their Souls; that though they could not avoid the firſt, yet that they might decline the ſecond
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95520:8"/>Death; and though their baſer part were caſt away, yet that their Souls might ſwim to, and Land ſafely on the Shoars of a bleſſed Eternity, and God's means do not uſe to be totally ineffectual, and in vain. The Word is ſeldom if ever preached, but that ſome are to be drawn out of the dead Sea, and called out of their Graves by it. <hi>Peter</hi> ſeems to tell us, that the Word was not wholly loſt on the Old World, but that ſome received ſaving Benefit by it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.6. <hi>For this cauſe was the Goſpel preached alſo to them that were dead, that they might be judged according to men in the fleſh, but live accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God in the ſpirit.</hi> This may be, <note place="margin">Vid. Piſcal in locum.</note> and is expounded to relate to, and point at the ſtate of the Old World; the Goſpel was preached to them, that though they were judged, were drowned, and periſhed in the Eye of Men as to their Fleſh, yet they might live to, and with God in their Spirits. Though God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed War againſt their Bodies, yet he tendred Peace to their Souls.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We may further Obſerve, that even thoſe that the Son of God Preaches to, may ſtop their Ears, cloſe their Eyes, harden their Hearts, and for their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95520:9"/>and Impenitency, may be caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God's Priſon, and periſh everlaſtingly. The Goſpel is to ſome <hi>the ſavour of death unto death,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. They did ſhut Chriſt out of their Souls, and for this are ſhut up under the wrath of God, and are the Subjects of Eternal Vengeance.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We may Obſerve what a hainous Evil Sin is, and what a terrible Adverſary God is: He did not only ſweep away the ſinners of the World, and drown their Bodies in a Flood of Waters, but he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned and puniſhed their Souls. God drowned their Spirits in Deſtruction and Perdition, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9. Sin is committed againſt an Infinite Majeſty, and cannot be ſufficiently puniſhed or ſatisfied for in a Finite Time, by a Finite Creature. It is an Axiom in the Civil Law, <hi>Accuſatio rei morte finitat:</hi> An Accuſation is finiſhed by the death of the guilty Perſon; all Proceſs and Proceedings then ceaſe againſt the Delinquent. But it is otherwiſe here; God's Accuſation is not let fall, his Actions are not withdrawn, his Controverſie doth not ceaſe when ſinners dye; he purſues and overtakes them in another World, there he meets them as one bereaved of his Authority, Honour, and Glory; by them, he reſents the wrongs done to him,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95520:9"/>he pours out the full Vials of his Wrath on them, and fights againſt them for ever. They are, that they may be Miſerables, a bare Stock of Being is continued, that God may graft Miſery and Eternal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on it.</p>
            <p>The words afford us two Doctrines: Firſt, That the Son of God did Preach before he was Incarnate, and doth as truly Preach by Inſtruments, as he doth immediately in his own Perſon when he appeared here in the World. The Second Doctrine that riſes from the latter words is this, That the Souls of wicked Men, after they are departed out of the Body, are confined to, and ſhut up in God's Priſon.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Doctrine. <hi>The Son of God preached be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was Incarnate, and doth as truly Preach by Inſtruments as he doth immediately in his own Perſon.</hi> We may here diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh three Preachings of Jeſus Chriſt. 1. He preached before his Incarnation. So in the Text the Son of God is ſaid to Preach to thoſe that were diſobedient in the days of <hi>Noah.</hi> The Goſpel was preached to them that formerly lived, but were dead in the days of <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.6. And who did then Preach it? It was the Son of God. <hi>He was in the world,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95520:10"/>and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not,</hi> John 1.10. He was in the World, and that to Teach and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the Souls of Men. His being in the World relates to the time before his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation; then he treated with, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed a way of Salvation to the periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souls of Men. He was in the World to give light to ſtraying Sinners, to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſleepy, to apprehend flying, to reſcue and ſave ſinning Souls. He was in the World before <hi>Abraham</hi> was choſen, and his Seed was taken as a Peculiar People, or the Son came to them as his own.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Son of God preached when he was manifeſted in the Fleſh. At <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth</hi> (where he was brought up, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.26.) he ſeems to Preach his firſt Sermon, and then he choſe that Text, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1. This Scripture evidences his Miſſion, and contains his Commiſſion: As Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors firſt ſhew their Credentials, before they enter into a Treaty with thoſe to whom they are ſent. So Chriſt, as the Father's Ambaſſador, produces his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentials, he ſaith, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord was upon him, for he anointed him to Preach glad tidings unto the meek.</hi> And Chriſt, in purſuance of his Commiſſion and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, <hi>went about preaching the glad
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95520:10"/>tidings of the Kingdom of God,</hi> Luke 8.1. <hi>Jeſus went about all</hi> Galilee, <hi>teaching in their Synagogues, and preaching the Goſpel of the Kingdom,</hi> Matth. 4.23. Jeſus was not idle, did not loyter, or trifle away his time, but was daily caſting his Net to take Souls, and calling Men from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan to God.
<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>When the Son of God was Incarnate, then</hi> Wiſdom cried with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.20. <hi>And</hi> the firſt-born of Gods new Family declared his Name to his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 22.22. Then the Church found him without, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.1. <hi>That is, come forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Nature.</hi>
               </note> And where he did not Convert Men, yet he did convince, and ſomewhat awaken and terrifie ſinners with the fear of Hell. In this ſenſe he is ſaid <hi>To ſmite the Earth with the Rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips to ſlay the wicked,</hi> Iſa. 11.4.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Now Chriſt is in Heaven he ſtill continues to Preach. Take heed, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.25. <hi>See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaketh — we ſhall not eſcape, if we turn away from him that ſpeaketh from Heaven.</hi> It was foretold that our Lord Jeſus ſhould ſpeak Peace to the Heathen, <hi>Zech.</hi> 9.10. So it was fulfilled by our Lord Jeſus. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, That Chriſt came to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> Preaching Peace to them that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95520:11"/>were afar off, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.17. Jeſus Chriſt was then aſcended to Heaven, yet even then he came to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and preached Peace. As he went to the Old World and preached before his Incarnation, ſo he came to <hi>Epheſus</hi> after his Aſcenſion, and proclaimed Peace; though he came into the World to wage War with Satan, and to deſtroy his works, yet he daily comes and preaches Peace to Sinners, and wooes, and beſeeches them to be reconciled to God <note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20.</note>. Thus you ſee that the Son of God preached by Inſtruments, and by his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors before and ſince his Incarnation as he preached immediately when he was here in the World.</p>
            <p>For the proſecuting of the Doctrine, I ſhall inſiſt upon theſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How fit the Son of God was to Preach. 2. What it was he did Preach. 3. To whom he did Preach.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall ſhew you how fit the Son of God is to Preach; and that in reſpect, 1. To the Divine Nature he poſſeſſes. 2. As to the Office he is cloathed with.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the Divine Nature he hath. 1. As he is God, he knows all things; as he was in the boſom of the Father from Eternity, <hi>John</hi> 1.18. He is conſcious to all his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95520:11"/>Secrets, he is privy to all his Thoughts of Grace, and Counſels of Peace, that did ſpring up in his Heart from Eternity concerning the Sons of Men. <hi>None knows the Father but the Son, and he to whom he will reveal him,</hi> Mat. 11.27. The Son knows the Father immediately, perfectly, and infallibly. As the Wiſdom of God, he hath a full Acquaintance with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; nothing is hid or concealed from him, what he hath ſeen with, and heard from the Father, that he teſtifieth, <hi>John</hi> 3.32. A Witneſs that reports what he hath heard and ſeen, is ſurely to be credited, and ſuch a Witneſs is Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.4. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.14. He was to bring forth Judgment to the Gentiles, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1. The Doctrine of the Goſpel is God's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning a way of Relief, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, and Salvation for Sinners. This Doctrine Chriſt was to bring forth, and that out of the boſom of the Father <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. in loc.</note> Theſe great Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets he was to reveal to the World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. None but the Son of God can give ſufficient Authority and Efficacy to the Word. 1. The Son gives Authority to the Goſpel, he that Preaches out of the boſom of the Father, <hi>John</hi> 1.18. He
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95520:12"/>that ſpeaks from the Throne of Majeſty and Glory <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.25.</note>, is to be regarded. The Word ought, and is to be received as the Word of God, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. It is to be entertained as a Law from his Mouth, <hi>Job</hi> 22.22. What the Son Preaches is ſtamped with a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority. All ſhould tremble at, and ſtand in awe of his Word.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Son of God only can give Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy to the Word. He that brought forth the Goſpel out of his Father's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, can bring it into our Hearts: He can ſow, cauſe the Seed to take Root, and change the Soil; he can write in the Tables of our Hearts, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. Jeſus Chriſt did not write the Goſpel with his own Hand in any Paper or Book, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and reſerved a more Noble Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to himſelf, which is moſt becoming of him, and peculiar to him. He writes in the Minds, Conſciences, and Wills of Men; and he writes not Letters, Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, bare Words or Sentences, but he writes Divine Truths, Supernatural My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, Spiritual Principles, Diſpoſitions, and Inclinations in the Souls of Men. The Son can come at, and write in that Table, that no other can reach, or make impreſſions on. And the Son of God can
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95520:12"/>write ſo effectually as to change a Heart of Stone to a fleſhy Table; he can ſoften and melt the Heart, and make it pliable and flexible. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.4. <hi>Hearken unto me, my People, and give ear unto me, O my Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for a Law ſhall proceed from me, and I will make my Judgment to reſt for a light of the People.</hi> When may the Son of God be ſaid to make his Judgment to reſt? I Anſwer, when he engrafts his Word, and cauſes it to joyn, unite, and cloſe with the Stock of the Heart, <hi>James</hi> 1.21. When the Seed is turned into a new and Divine Nature, when in this Noble Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of it, it dwelleth and abideth in the Soul for ever, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. When it is mixed with Faith, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.3.</note> when it molds and faſhions the Soul into a Conformity to God, and a compliance with his Will; then it may be ſaid truly to reſt and abide. A Graft that is not implanted into the Stock, a Stone that is not joyned to the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may be ſpurned to and fro; but when the Graft is united with the Stock, and the Stone is laid into the Building, then it hath reſt. None can give a Reſt in this ſenſe to to the Doctrine of the Goſpel but the Son of God, and how weak ſoever Inſtruments are, yet he can
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95520:13"/>produce mighty Effects, when he ſpeaks in them, and by them
<note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3.</note> 
               <hi>Out of the mouths of babes and ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks he ordains ſtrength,</hi> Pſal. 8.2. The Diſciples of Chriſt were but as Babes and Sucklings, they were not trained up in the Schools of Philoſophers, or Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricians, but were <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, Ideots, that have a very low Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of Reaſon, a ſcanty meaſure of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding at utmoſt, fitting them to manage their own Private Affairs, and ſmall Concerns, but diſabling them from being employed in any Great, High, and Publick Affairs. How Obſervable is it then, that the Son of God ſhould chooſe, and employ Men of ſuch mean Parts in the moſt high, weighty, and important Matters of his Kingdom, and accompliſh ſuch great and Noble things by them? The Son of God did ſpeak in them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. and work with them, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.20. ſo that they proſelyted a world of Enemies, and diſcipled Barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Faith of Chriſt. They fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed the Heathen Gods of the Earth,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95520:13"/>
               <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.11. They drew away their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers, and deprived them of their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. The Hands of theſe Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men cultivated and manured a barren and horrid Wilderneſs, and reduced it to be a Spiritual Paradiſe, and Garden of God. The word of the Croſs, ſignified by the Living Water that came out from the ſide of the Altar, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47.1, 2. flowing out into the ſalt and dead Sea of the World, did heal theſe brackiſh, unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and unwholſom Waters. O, how wonderful was the Son of God in this, that a little ſtream of Doctrine concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt crucified, ſhould heal, and make freſh the Waters of the great Sea of this corrupt and degenerate World! How ſtrange and ſurprizing is this! that ſuch few and weak Hands ſhould pull down Satan's Kingdom? ſhould build the Ruines of many Generations, and wreſt the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives from the Srong, and the Prey from the Mighty: The Arrows that the Son of God did ſhoot by his Miniſters, did hit right, pierce deep, and cauſe ſinners to fall under them</p>
            <p n="2">2. If we conſider the Office the Son of God doth ſuſtain, and is inveſted with, this fits him to Preach to a ſinful and loſt World. He is ſtyled a Mediator, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:95520:14"/>2.5. If he had not undertaken to ſatisfie Juſtice, and make Peace, God would have kept ſilence as to any gracious or comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſpeaking to the World. Had not he interpoſed between guilty Creatures and an angry God, we could have heard nothing elſe from Heaven but denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Vengeance, threatnings of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and meſſages of Death. But now lively Oracles come from the Mercy-ſeat, ſprinkled with the Blood of the Mediator. He that hath made a Teſtament, and ſealed it with his own Blood, is fitteſt to open, publiſh, and declare it. He that was intimate with God, and acquainted with all his deep Deſigns, and Boſom-Secrets, was fitteſt to bring them forth, and make them known to the World. He that was to execute God's Purpoſes, was meeteſt to reveal them. God had Deſigns of Grace, Counſels of Peace, Purpoſes of Redemption and Salvation, that were conceived in his Mind, and formed in his Heart from Eternity. But theſe could not ſtep forth into execution but by the Interpoſition and Sufferings of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>The pleaſure of the Lord was to proſper in his hand,</hi> Iſa. 53.10. And what his Hand was to accompliſh, his Mouth was to reveal. He that ſatisfied Juſtice,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95520:14"/>was fitteſt to diſcover Grace and Mercy. The Lord Jeſus is ſtyled <hi>the High-Priest, and Apoſtle of our Profeſſion,</hi> Heb. 3.1. What he merited as an High-Prieſt, that he is meeteſt to reveal and declare as an Apoſtle. We may ſee infinite Wiſdom in this: He that makes Peace by the Blood of his Croſs, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. He ſpeaks Peace, <hi>Zech.</hi> 9.10. He preaches Peace, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.17. He that paid the Ranſom, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.28. He preaches Deliverance to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and the opening of the Priſon to them that are bound, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1. He that was taken from Priſon and Judgment him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.8. He calls Priſoners to come forth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.9. He bids thoſe that are in Darkneſs to ſhew themſelves in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Sanctuary, and the Glorious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God. He that was a Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with Grief, he is the Conſolation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and comforts thoſe that mourn, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.3. with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.2. He that became the Father's Servant himſelf, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1. Proclaims the Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Year of the Lord, publiſhes a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Jubilee to us, for the releaſe of our Souls, from the Servitude of Sin, from the Bondage of Satan. Man being fallen under the Wrath of God, the Curſe of the Law, the Sentence of Death, none
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95520:15"/>but a Mediator that was made Sin and a Curſe for us, could bring us any good News, could publiſh any glad Tidings, that might be a Foundation for our Faith and Hope, relieve and revive our fainting and ſinking Souls. He that is the Wiſdom of God, and knows all, was fitteſt to be the Word of the Father to reveal all.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, I ſhall now conſider, what it is that the Son of God Preaches.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Jeſus Chriſt Preaches the Doctrine of Faith, and calls Men to believe it. He Preaches good Tidings, and that to the Poor, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. The Law promiſes Life, and publiſhes good Tidings only to thoſe that are Rich in Habitual Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and perfect Active Obedience: But Jeſus Chriſt Preaches good Tidings to thoſe that are exceeding Poor; to ſuch as have no good dwelling in them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. or good done by them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.12. Compare thoſe two Expreſſions; <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>In me, even in this fleſh of mine, dwells no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all that is good: There is none that doth good, no, not one.</hi> O, how ſweet a Sentence is this, that Jeſus Chriſt preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth glad Tidings to the Poor! Jeſus Chriſt Preaches Righteouſneſs. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.9, 10. <hi>I have preached Righteouſneſs in the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ation, I have not hid thy Righteouſneſs in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95520:15"/>my heart.</hi> Theſe words are ſpoken by the Son of God concerning himſelf; the Righteouſneſs he preached was a great Secret, a deep Myſtery. We ſhould have been for ever ignorant of it if he had hid it in his Heart: But this Righteouſneſs of God is revealed in the Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. And it is that which Faith muſt Act, and live upon from firſt to laſt; therefore it is ſaid, to be <hi>revealed from Faith to Faith,</hi> from a leſſer to a higher degree of Faith. This is a wonderful and comfortable Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, it conſiſts in Jeſus Chriſt his perfect obeying the Commands of the Law, and his bearing the Penalty and Curſe of it; and both theſe are the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Faith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. Precious Faith, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. I would render the words, In the Righteouſneſs of God, and of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo to note the Object of Faith. And this Expreſſion may expound to us, why this Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is called the Righteouſneſs of God; becauſe the Perſon that wrought it out was God and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. This is not an exacting, an obliging, a menacing, or threatning Righteouſneſs, that is ſufficiently declared in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and Threatnings of the Law; but this is a Righteouſneſs wrought for us, not
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95520:16"/>by us; a Righteouſneſs dwelling in Chriſt, but imputed to us; a Righteouſneſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and brought by Chriſt, and freely given to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17. The Law can tell us of a Debt of Righteouſneſs that we owe, but the Goſpel acquaints us with a Gift of Righteouſneſs that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. And it is the empty hand of Faith that receives this Gift, the hand of a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the hand of a Beggar, the weak, trembling, Palſie hand may receive a Rich Gift, a Jewel of ineſtimable Price. And Chriſt's Blood is alſo ſet forth as an Object of Faith. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a Propitiation through Faith in his Blood.</hi> The Blood of Jeſus Chriſt is Reconciling, Redeeming, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing, Purging, and Purifying Blood, and therefore is a Noble Object of Faith. And add to this the Arm of the Son of God to reſcue us, ſubdue us, and deſtroy Satan's Works out of us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.5. And we have a compleat Object of Faith: This Arm of his the Son of God reveals, and reaches out to us, for our weak, faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, heavy laden, and ſinking Souls to lean on, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.5. This is an Arm that can Root up Satan's Tares, pull down all his ſtrong Holds, and break all his Bonds and Snares. And Jeſus Chriſt is alſo the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95520:16"/>Meſſenger of the Covenant, <hi>Malachy</hi> 3.1. He reveals to us a Covenant of Grace and Peace, a Covenant that ſecures us from the Evils that we deſerve, and dread; and ſo it is all our Salvation, and promiſes all the Good we need; and ſo it is all that we deſire, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. It is ordered ſo as to meet with all our Objections, and ſilence them; to quaſh our Fears, and to ſupply our Wants. The Son of God commands us to believe his Goſpel, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.15. To look to him for Salvation, to fly to him as a City of Refuge, to get under his ſhadow, that he may protect and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us from the ſcorching Wrath of the Almighty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Son of God Preaches Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Repent, for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven is at hand.</hi> God was then about to erect that Kingdom that was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.44. <hi>Daniel</hi> did Propheſie, That the God of Heaven would ſet up a Kingdom, and ſo it might be ſaid to be the Kingdom of Heaven. It is Heavenly in its Original, Heaven is the Subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matter promiſed in the Goſpel, it iſſues in the Heavenly Life, and Happineſs of thoſe that believe.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95520:17"/>30. Chriſt requires Men to Repent of their low, baſe, hard, reproachful thoughts of God; to Repent of their Enmity, Whoredoms, and Rebellions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God. Doth God ſhew himſelf as Love, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.8. I, and ſhall not Men Repent of their Hatred of God? Is he willing to lay aſide his Juſt and Righteous Enmity againſt us? And ſhall we not lay aſide our wicked Enmity againſt him? Jeſus Chriſt may very reaſonably require us to Repent, ſeeing God doth change his Diſpenſations towards us; and this may be called God's Repenting; he might have hardened his Heart againſt us, but now his Bowels yearn towards us: he might have aſcended a Tribunal of Juſtice, and given Sentence on us; but he ſits on a Throne of Grace, and offers Mercy to us. He might have drawn his Flaming Sword to deſtroy, but he ſtretches out his Golden Sceptre to ſave. God curſes ſinners in the Law, but bleſſes them as Believers in the Goſpel: He Condemns in the Law, but Juſtifies in the Goſpel; he rejects and diſinherits in the Law, but he receives and Adopts in the Goſpel: Doth God Repent of the evil of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and may he not well call Men to Repent of the evil of Sin? Is God's Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95520:17"/>Hand bound, and ſhall our Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Hand be looſe and at liberty to fight againſt God? Jeſus Chriſt calls us to deny our ſelves, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24. — Man fell from God into himſelf; intruded into his Throne, uſurped his Rights, alienated the Creatures from God, and turned them againſt him. Sinful Man is the Voluntier, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the preſſed Souldiers to fight againſt God; and ſhall Man, ſo mean a Creature, make himſelf the Soveraign Lord, and the laſt end of all the other Creatures? Shall Man, now become ſo filthy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed a Creature, dote on himſelf? Shall he that is ſo hateful, inordinately love himſelf? Shall he that is ſo poor, ſo empty, ſo vain a Creature, lift up, exalt himſelf, and be proud of an imaginary, and meerly conceited Excellency? And hath not the Lord Jeſus to amazement denied himſelf? <hi>He that was Rich, for our ſakes became poor,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.9. <hi>He that was in the form of God, and thought it no robbery to be equal with God,</hi> yet did empty himſelf of his Fulneſs, and caſt a Veil over all his own Glory; <hi>took on him the form of a Servant,</hi> Phil. 2.6, 7. The O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean became as it were a drop; he whoſe goings forth from the Father were from Everlaſting, yet but as yeſterday came
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95520:18"/>forth from <hi>Bethlehem, Micah</hi> 5.2. The Ancient of Days became an Infant of Days; he that bears up all things, was carried in Arms; he that knew no ſin, was made ſin, and <hi>God bleſſed for ever,</hi> Rom. 9.5. <hi>Was made a curſe,</hi> Gal. 3.13. And hath our Lord thus denied himſelf, and ſhall Servants ſeek and pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? And Jeſus Chriſt calls us to take his Yoke, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29. And did he not take a harder and heavier Yoke on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for us? He puts his Name into our Bond, and became a Surety for us; the Debt was great he was to diſcharge, it was not to be paid off with Gold and Silver, but with Blood; the Debt was not only poſſible, or probable, or likely only to fall on him, but certainly to take hold of him, and to be required of him: He was to be wounded with the Sword of his own Father, to bear the heavieſt Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, to drink the moſt bitter Cup; this Lamb of God was to be roaſted by the hotteſt Fire, he was to ſweat Blood, and to pour out his Soul to the Death; and is it not reaſonable now that the Son of God ſhould require us to renounce our depraved Wills, baſe Luſts, and vile Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and put our Necks under his eaſie Yoke, bound on us by Cords of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95520:18"/>Love? Did our Lord ſubmit and obey, and ſhall we be proud, diſobedient, and rebellious?</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Son of God preached Peace, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.17. His Goſpel is a Goſpel of Peace, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.15. His Covenant a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Peace, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.10. In the days of his Fleſh he preached Peace, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.36. And now he ſtill publiſheth Peace to humbled Sinners. This Peace the Son of God Preaches is a coſtly and righteous Peace: His own Father did wage War with him, that he might make Peace with us, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.7. He called the Sword of his Juſtice to awake, ſmite, and wound his own Son: The Sufferings, the Wounds of Chriſt were great and deep; they came from, they were made by the awakened Sword of Juſtice. Our Sins had made a wide Breach between God and us, and this Breach was filled by the dead Body of Jeſus Chriſt. Our Iniquities had kindled the Fire of God's Wrath, and this Fire was quenched by the Blood of the Son of God. He made Peace for our Souls, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he made Atonement for our Sins.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Jeſus Chriſt preached Salvation, <hi>That we ſhould be ſaved from the hands of our Enemies, and from all that hated us,</hi> Luke 1.71. Sin and Death are our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95520:19"/>wicked Men and Satan hate us; here is a Salvation from Enemies, and all that hate us. And this is a full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Salvation; Chriſt ſaves from ſin, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.21. And he ſaves from wrath, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. And by his own Sufferings he was delivered up to Death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. that he might deliver us from the Wrath to come, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. <hi>laſt.</hi> He fell into the hands of God as an angry Judge, that we might not fall into the Bottomleſs-pit. He went out into the moſt dreadful Storm, that he might allay it, and free us from it. The Cup of Wrath came to him, that the Cup of Salvation might come to us. Jeſus Chriſt could not have been a Shield to us, if he had not been pierced by the Arrows of Divine Vengeance him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He could not have been a ſhadow to us from the burning, ſcorching Wrath of God, if he had not been himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to it. That Cloud that skreened <hi>Iſrael</hi> from the hotteſt Beams of the Sun, was expoſed to them; that Cloud did not feel the burning Beams of the Sun, but Jeſus Chriſt had a tender ſenſe and feeling of the Wrath of God, that for our ſakes he was liable to.</p>
            <pb n="29" facs="tcp:95520:19"/>
            <p n="5">5. Jeſus Chriſt preached the Kingdom of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.23. <hi>He went about Preaching the Goſpel of the Kingdom, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the glad Tidings of the Kingdom of God,</hi> Luke 8.1. Jeſus Chriſt doth not only Preach to us Salvation from the greateſt Evil, but alſo the Enjoyment of the higheſt Good. The Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.10. ſaith, <hi>The Elect ſhall obtain the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation that is in Chriſt, together with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Glory.</hi> As <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> were not only called out of, and ſaved from the Fiery Furnace, but alſo promoted and exalted to Honour and Rule in the Province of <hi>Babylon, Dan.</hi> 3. <hi>laſt.</hi> So Believers are not only preſerved from a Furnace of Fire, but alſo called into a Glorious Kingdom; they do not only eſcape Ruin, but are advanced to Reign. And this Kingdom is bequeathed by Jeſus Chriſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; the word, as <hi>Budaeus</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">In Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cae Linguae.</note> obſerves, is <hi>Verbum Teſtamentale,</hi> a word uſed by the <hi>Graecians</hi> in making their Wills. Though in the account of wicked Men Jeſus Chriſt died as a Malefactor, yet in the Eye of God he died as a Teſtator; when he was rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of his Liberty, Garments, and Life, then he bequeathed a Kingdom to enrich
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95520:20"/>us for ever. The Eternal Inheritance is a Legacy of Chriſt's Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. Chriſt that is Heir of all things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. takes us to be Coheirs with himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. Thoſe that ſerve God ſhall Reign, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.3.5. And thoſe that are Subjects to Chriſt ſhall wear a Glorious and Everlaſting Crown, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10. As the Blood of Chriſt keeps deſtroying Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice out, ſo it gives us boldneſs to enter into the Heavenly Sanctuary, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Croſs of Chriſt is preached, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.19.23. as the Meritorious cauſe of all Good. Chriſt's Poverty enriches us, his Abaſement Exalts us, his Infamy is our Glory: He is a Prieſt of good things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.11. he merits and procures them by his Sacrifice. The Death and Teſtament of Jeſus Chriſt is the very Foundation of our hopes of, and of our call to the Everlaſting Inheritance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. In the Civil Law
<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Inſtitut. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 19. <hi>Sect.</hi> 6.</note>, he that is an Heir is ſaid to be <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catus ad haereditatem,</hi> and that by the Teſtament of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed. This much illuſtrates Spiritual things; Chriſt makes a Teſtament, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns Heirs, and calls them in due time to what he hath deſigned for them. The
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95520:20"/>Croſs of Chriſt ſhould be preached, and the Death of the Son of God ſhould be moſt valuable in our Eye, becauſe this is the Foundation and Confirmation of Chriſt's Teſtament. If he had not made a Will, and died to confirm it, there had been no Heirs appointed, there had been no Inheritance bequeathed, and there had been no ground to call any to the Kingdom and Glory of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To whom did the Son of God Preach? I Anſwer, ſometimes to more, ſometimes to fewer; before <hi>Abraham</hi> was called, and his Seed choſen and ſeparated to be God's Peculiar and only People, he preached more or leſs to all Mankind, if they did not cut off, and caſt themſelves out by their Negligence and Profaneneſs, as <hi>Cain</hi>'s Poſterity ſeemed to do. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God made an Incloſure of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, when he took <hi>Abraham,</hi> redeemed him from his Idolatry, and called him from his Ignorance and Blindneſs. Since that, God hath made a Common inſtead of an Incloſure. We read of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Faith, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.4. And of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Salvation, <hi>Jude's Epiſtle, Verſe</hi> 3. After Chriſt's death the Hedges were pulled <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 14 23.</note> up, the Incloſure thrown open. Chriſt was to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95520:21"/>be a Light to the Gentiles, and to be Gods Salvation to the ends of the Earth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.6. The Son of God is the true <hi>Univerſal Biſhop,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>laſt.</hi> The whole World is his Dioceſs. This Husbandman goeth forth to ſow, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.3. and the large Field that he ſows in is the World. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.38. <hi>The Field is the World.</hi> This Noble Fiſherman doth not Fiſh in the Rill of a Village, in the Rivulet of a City, in the River of one Country, but in the Sea of the wide World. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.47. <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a Net caſt into the Sea.</hi> It is obſervable what the Son of God ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.9. <hi>I have preached Righteouſneſs in the great Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> What is this great Congregation? It is the Church made up of <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile;</hi> it is Men of all Nations: He did not come only to call the <hi>Jews,</hi> to raiſe up <hi>Jacob,</hi> and to reſtore <hi>Iſrael, Iſa.</hi> 49.4, 5. but he was to gather the Kingdoms of the Earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.22. To gather all Nations, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.17. To call and bring home Sheep, that were not of the Fold of the Jewiſh Church, <hi>John</hi> 10.16. The Son of God preached to the Heathen, <hi>Zech.</hi> 9.10. cauſed Barbarous People, and the Inhabitants of Wilderneſſes to bow to his Sceptre, and to ſubmit to his Authority.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95520:21"/>
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.9. <hi>They that dwell in the wilderneſs ſhall bow before him, and his Enemies ſhall lick the duſt; yea, the Kings and Great Ones of the World ſhall fall down before him as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and Worſhippers.</hi> And the Son of God preached with ſuch Authority, Efficacy, and Succeſs, that <hi>thoſe that knew him not before, did at his call run to him,</hi> Iſa. 55.5. <hi>And fly as the Clouds, and Doves to their windows,</hi> Iſa. 60.8. As the Jews did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly attend on the Miniſtry of God's Prophets, <hi>Zech.</hi> 11.11. <hi>The poor of the Flock that waited on me:</hi> So now the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſhould wait on the Son of God, liſten to his Doctrine, and receive his Law: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.5. <hi>The Iſles ſhall wait upon me.</hi> And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.4. <hi>The Iſles ſhall wait for his Law.</hi> By the Iſles we are to underſtand the Gentile Nations that were beyond the Seas, and lived remote from the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> even theſe ſhould wait for the Rain of Chriſt's Doctrine, for the Dew of his Word; they ſhould ſubmit to be Scholars when the Son of God did Teach, and become his Diſciples when he did call: As <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.2, 3. The Gentiles ſhould exhort one another, and ſay, <hi>Come, let us go up to the Mountain of the Lord's Houſe, for he will teach us his ways, and we will walk in them.</hi> This is obſervable, that the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95520:22"/>Lord is not ſaid to Teach alike every where, but in the Mount of his Houſe, that is, in his Church he Teaches; here it is Day when it is Night with other Parts of the World. <hi>Darkneſs doth cover the Earth, groſs darkneſs the People, but the Glory of the Lord ariſeth on, and ſhines in the Church,</hi> Iſa. 60.1, 2, 3. Therefore the Gentiles are ſaid to repair to the Churches Light with a full Reſolution to yield, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and obey what the Son of God ſhould teach as Truth, and dictate as Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I ſhall come now to the Uſe of the Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. The Son of God preached by Inſtruments, and hath alſo preached im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately in his own Perſon; this may inform us of the wonderful Grace and Kindneſs of Jeſus Chriſt: As a Prieſt he purchaſes Good Things for us, and as a Prophet he Preaches them to us. He bought precious things dearly at God's hands, and he propoſeth, and proffers them freely to our hands; he procured an Inheritance, provided a Feaſt, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Salvation, and he promulgates and declares them to us. O, what a conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention is this! that the Son of God ſhould be a Herald to Proclaim Peace, and the King of Glory ſhould deign to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95520:22"/>be the Father's Ambaſſador, to treat with Rebels, and beſeech Enemies to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Here is great matter of Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that the Son of God Preacheth as truly by Inſtruments, as in his own Perſon: He can give Efficacy and Succeſs to his own Word. Our caſe were deplorable, yea, deſperate, if Men only did Preach. Could they open blind Eyes, unſtop deaf Ears, quicken dead Souls? As <hi>Eglon</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants did wait till they were aſhamed, for his riſing and opening the Parlour-door to them, <hi>Judges</hi> 3.23.25. But their waiting and expectation was in vain, <hi>Ehud</hi> had killed <hi>Eglon</hi> the King of <hi>Moab, Judg.</hi> 3.21, 22, and a dead Man could not open the Door to his waiting Servants without. So Sinners are dead in Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, and in the uncircumciſion of their Fleſh, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.13. And can ſuch ariſe and open the doors of their Hearts to the Son of God? Free-will ruined Mankind when the Image of God was drawn on their Souls, and the Law of God was written in their Hearts; and will Free-will now raiſe and recover Man again out of his Ruins with the aids of Common Grace, when the poor Sinner is a Captive under the Law of Sin and Death? This was
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95520:23"/>the great Encouragement that Chriſt gave his Apoſtles to go forth into the World and Teach all Nations, <hi>That he was, and would be with them to the end of the World,</hi> Matth. 28 19, 20. He that had all Power both in Heaven and Earth, could make way for his own Word, and cauſe it to be received and entertained. Miniſters need the ſpecial Preſence, and the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Working of the Son of God with them. Weak and degenerate Man doth not only need an <hi>Auxilium ſine quo non,</hi> ſuch an aid, without which they cannot believe or come to Chriſt, but an <hi>Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium cum quo,</hi> as <hi>Janſenius</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>In his.</hi> Auguſt.</note> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently and truly diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. We need ſuch an aid as will certainly produce the Effect: Such an aid as Free-will is Lord of, and is to Husband and Improve, will not ſuffice for our Recovery; but ſuch an aid of Grace we need as will Lord it in our Will, and effectually incline it to yield and ſubmit to Chriſt. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.37. <hi>I will cauſe them to paſs under the Rod, I will bring them into the bond of the Covenant. Bleſſed is he whom thou chooſeſt, and cauſeſt to draw nigh,</hi> Pſal. 65.4. Chriſt can ſo influence the Will, as to undertake it ſhall, and cauſe it to comply. <hi>Ars Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtis
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95520:23"/>Medici eſt Demonſtrativae,</hi> as <hi>Alva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">De Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liis gratiae.</note> truly aſſerts; it is in the Hand and Power of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Phyſician to Cure the Will of its Malignity, Enmity, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. Surely he can Cure whom he will, and when he will, elſe he were not infinitely Wiſe and Omnipotent. He could undertake that the Gentiles, though deaf, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.18. yea, though dead, <hi>John</hi> 5.25. ſhould hear his Voice, and be joyned with his Flock, and gathered into his Fold. God bids <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſmite the Rock, and it ſhould give forth Water for the Thirſty <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to drink, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17 6. But would the Rock yield Water if <hi>Moſes</hi> alone had been there, and ſmitten it with his Arm? No, a ſtruck Rock would yield rather ſparks of Fire, than floods of Water, had not the Lord ſtood on the Rock, and cauſed it to cleave; <hi>and turned the Flint into a Fountain of Waters,</hi> Pſal. 114. <hi>laſt.</hi> So in vain would Chriſt's Miniſters ſmite on the Rocky Hearts of Men to draw Penitential Tears from thence, if the Son of God doth not ſtand on this Rock, and ſo melt and diſſolve it into Floods of Godly Sorrow. In vain would our hands knock at the Door of Mens Hearts, if Jeſus Chriſt had not a Hand to open them.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95520:24"/>
               <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14. <hi>The Lord opened the heart of</hi> Lydia, <hi>and then ſhe attended to what</hi> Paul <hi>ſpake.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Lord ſpake to him with a ſtrong hand, and that he ſhould not walk in the way of that People,</hi> Iſa. 8.11. The Lord ſpeaks with a ſtrong Hand when he levels Mountains of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, conquers Enmity, and effectually Plants the Word in the Heart. The Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom did not only give ſweet Names to, and uſe ſtrong Arguments with the Church, why ſhe ſhould riſe and open to him, but he put in his Hand by the hole of the Door, he touched her Heart, he ſtirred her Affections, he moved her Bowels to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and then ſhe roſe to open to him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2.4, 5, 6. This is a great Encouragement, that Miniſters do not ſpeak alone, but Chriſt ſpeaks in them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. And they do not act alone, but the Lord Chriſt works with them, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. Doth the Son of God Preach as well by Inſtruments, as when he Preaches immediately in his own Perſon? Then, 1. Be convinced, that whoever Preaches, that you have to do with the Son of God; it is he that ſpeaks to, and deals with your Souls. <hi>Noah</hi> he treated with, and preached to the Old World; he is ſtyled, <hi>A Preacher
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95520:24"/>of Righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.5. But in the Text <hi>Peter</hi> doth over-look him, and keep ſilence concerning him, and ſaith, The Son of God went by his Divine Nature, and preached to the old World that were diſobedient in the days of <hi>Noah:</hi> As the light of the Sun doth obſcure, darken, and hide the Stars, ſo this Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs by his Glorious Light doth darken all the dim and little Candles he doth make uſe of. O! how ſhould this awe our Hearts, and make us to tremble at the Word, that it is the Son of God that Preacheth, and diſpenſeth it to us?</p>
            <p n="2">2. This ſhould make us forward, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and ready to hear, becauſe it is the Son of God that Preacheth: If Chriſt were now on Earth, and was to Preach at ſuch a place to day, and at another place to morrow, would not Men and Women run, and flock to hear him? Should we not charge folly on, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute ſin to thoſe that would not lay aſide Excuſes, neglect their little petty Affairs and Concerns in the World, to hear the Son of God Incarnate? And yet when the Son of God Preaches by Inſtruments, how ingenious are Perſons to invent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to neglect and hinder themſelves from hearing Chriſt ſpeaking by his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors?
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95520:25"/>They will not, with the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p n="1">1. It is Wiſdom that Preaches to you: <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.20, 21, 22. The Son of God is the Wiſdom of God, and Wiſdom is now come forth into our Nature, and cries without in our Streets. Doth not Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom deſerve to be ſtyled, <hi>A wonderful Counſellor,</hi> Iſa. 9.6. who is ſo fit to adviſe us how to fly from the Wrath to come,

Who is ſo meet to Teach and Direct us how we may come out of Debt, and get out of Priſon, as Infinite Wiſdom? Who can ſo well In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us how our Conſciences may be purged, the fore-skin of our Hearts cut off, our Diſeaſes healed, our Guilt and Filth purged away, as the Wiſdom of God? Shall we exalt our vain Minds, and our fooliſh Underſtandings in Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Counſels and Dictates of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? We are entangled in a Wilderneſs of Woe, we are in a Labyrinth of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and Guilt, and Wiſdom only can teach us the right way to get out, and lead us to the Glorious City of God above. We knew not how God ſhould be Juſt, and yet juſtifie the Ungodly; how his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſhould be glorified in Puniſhing, and yet his Mercy magnified in Pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; how Sin ſhould meet with a Hell of Puniſhments, and yet Sinners enjoy a Heaven of Bleſſedneſs. Yet the Son of God, that is, Wiſdom, doth reconcile theſe things, and make them to conſiſt with each other.</p>

If he had not been Love it ſelf, he could never have ſtooped ſo low, have drank ſo bitter a Cup, have endured ſo heavy a Burden, have expoſed himſelf to ſo dreadful a Storm. <hi>He that was Rich, became Poor,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.9. He that was the Holy One of God, and without ſpot and blemiſh, was made Sin; he that was <hi>God over all, bleſſed for ever,</hi> Rom. 9.5. <hi>Was made a Curſe,</hi> John 3.14. And in order to all this, he that made all things, was made Fleſh, <hi>John</hi> 1.1, 2.14. He ſhewed himſelf to be Love, that as a Head he would chooſe and take a Body below; and as a Bridegroom be related to a Spouſe on Earth. O, how wonderful is this! that Nobility ſhould wooe Vileneſs and Baſeneſs? That Riches ſhould court Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty? And Beauty be enamoured with Deformity? O! is it not wonderful Love, that the Heir of all things ſhould make Addreſſes to thoſe that had nothing, yea, were indeed worſe than nothing? For nothing cannot go Aſtray, cannot run a Whoring, cannot Rebel, and Provoke; yet ſinful Men and Women are guilty of

There is a Name of the Father, that the World would never, could never have known, had not the Son declared it. The Law declares, That God loves Righteouſneſs, and hath a delight in Righteous Men; and that he will do good to thoſe that be good. But if Men break his Laws, caſt off his Yoke, reject his Authority, the Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth Wrath and Vengeance, threatens Sinners with Perdition and Deſtruction.

Account that God hath Grace to exerciſe towards the underſerving, yea, ill deſerving; that he hath any Pity to extend to thoſe that have provoked his Anger, and affronted his Infinite Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty. This is a great Secret, that God will ſtretch out his Hand from Heaven to raiſe up fallen Man; that he will provide a Laver to waſh foul and filthy Sinners in, that he will out off his own Plea againſt Offenders, ſheath his Sword, and provide a Satisfaction for his own Juſtice, and pay himſelf out of the Blood of his own Son.

            <p n="3">3. Jeſus Chriſt Preacheth theſe Great and Excellent Things as in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure come, and now actually exhibited to us. The Patriarchs ſaw the Promiſes afar off, but the Watchmen of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel are ſaid to ſee Eye to Eye, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.8. They behold the things that were future, now to be accompliſhed, come, and performed. The Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets Propheſied until <hi>John, Matth.</hi> 11.13. They ſpake of Chriſt, and his Kingdom as future things; but now ſince that time the Kingdom of God is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and every Man preſſeth into it, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.16. Now the Kingdom of God is come, is ſet up; the Meſſiah hath paſſed through, and laid aſide the form of a Servant, and hath put on the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and Form of a Lord; the low ſtate of the Meſſiah, his Humiliation is paſt, he is entred into his Glory; theſe Glad Tydings are now publiſhed to us, that our God who ſerved below, now Reigneth above, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.7.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Son of God Preacheth the moſt Excellent Things as ſure Mercies, and to be obtained in a Righteous way;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95520:35"/>
               <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3. <hi>I will give you the ſure Mercies of David;</hi> that is, of the Meſſiah, that was not only the Son of <hi>David,</hi> but alſo Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified and ſhadowed out by him. And theſe Mercies are ſaid to be ſure, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt is dead, and riſen again, and can dye no more, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.34, 35. Lives to Intercede for his Purchaſe, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute his Teſtament. The Son of God hath taken a Sure, a Juſt, and Righteous way to impart and communicate Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Benefits to us: They come not as Gifts from a Living Perſon, but as Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies from a Dying, yea, Dead Perſon. The Son of God dyed in our Nature to Ratifie and Confirm his own Teſtament, and to make it irrevocable. If a Man's Teſtament be eſtabliſhed by his Death, there is no diſannulling of it, or adding to it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.15. Chriſt's Teſtament cannot be fruſtrated, it muſt be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: This makes the greateſt Spiritual Benefits, yea, the Eternal Inheritance ſure to us, that they come to us in a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way. Jeſus Chriſt bequeaths nothing but what he purchaſed by his own Blood. The Lord Jeſus is the Mediator of the New Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. not only as he dyed to Ratifie it, but as he lives,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95520:35"/>and continually Intercedes with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Heaven for the fulfilling and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting of his Teſtament. And will you not liſten to the Son of God, as opening, promulgating, and declaring his own Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and the Riches and Fulneſs of it? Other Men's Teſtaments do make Heirs, but they cannot make Children: But in the Teſtament of Chriſt a new Heart, a new Spirit, and the Holy Ghoſt to ſanctifie and quicken, are bequeathed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26, 27. Thoſe that are ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renewed, are regenerated by vertue of this Promiſe, and ſo are ſtyled, <hi>The Children of Promiſe, Gal.</hi> 4.28. We Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was, are Children of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was born by vertue of God's Promiſe; <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.9. <hi>At this time will I come, and</hi> Sarah <hi>ſhall have a Son.</hi> So Saints now are Children of Promiſe, they are born again by vertue of this Promiſe; <hi>A new Heart will I give to them, a new Spirit will I put into them,</hi> Ezek. 36.26. And as all the Grace we have is from the Womb of the Promiſe, ſo all the Glory we hope for is by the Promiſe; and therefore Believers are alſo ſtyled, <hi>The Heirs of Promiſe,</hi> Heb. 6.17, 18. O, how is Chriſt's Teſtament ordered! firſt,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95520:36"/>to make us Children, and then to make us Heirs. Firſt, to make us Holy, and then to make us Happy. And will you not believe on, and ſubmit to the Son of God, that Preacheth his own Teſtament? Firſt, to impart to us a Divine Nature, and then to communicate to us an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Kingdom, an Everlaſting Glory.</p>
            <p>I ſhall proceed to Propoſe a few Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, and ſo conclude my Diſcourſe on the firſt Doctrine.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If the Son of God Preaches as well, and as truly by Inſtruments, as in his own Perſon immediately, then believe it is the Voice of the Son of God that ſounds in your Ears; and believe ſoundly and deeply what he Preacheth. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it is the Voice of the Son of God that you hear; <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.7. <hi>To day if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</hi> There is not only the Voice of Miniſters, and Ambaſſadors, but alſo the Voice of the King of Glory. Chriſt draws near, and comes with them; <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.17. <hi>He came and preached Peace to you that were afar off.</hi> And Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaks in them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3.</p>
            <pb n="63" facs="tcp:95520:36"/>
            <p n="2">2. Believe ſoundly and ſincerely what Chriſt Preacheth; <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. <hi>With the heart Man believeth unto Righteouſneſs.</hi> Acts 8.37. <hi>If thou believeſt with all thy heart.</hi> You ſhould believe ſo as to be ſure, and fully perſwaded in your own Minds; <hi>John</hi> 6.69. <hi>We believe, and are ſure that thou art Christ, the Son of the Living God. Let us draw near with a true Heart, in full aſſurance of Faith,</hi> Heb. 10.22. We may confidently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye on the Word, and we may boldly lean on the Arm of the Son of God. <hi>This is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the World to ſave Sinners,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.15. It is a Faithful Saying, the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may acquieſce in it; and it is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all Acceptation, therefore the Will may embrace it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Make Particular Application of Chriſt's Word and Doctrine to your own Souls. Account that Chriſt as truly Addreſſeth himſelf to you, as if he did from Heaven call you by Name, and apply himſelf to you; <hi>John</hi> 10.3. <hi>He
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95520:37"/>calleth his own Sheep by Name.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt with an effectual Call makes Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to know that he ſpeaks as expreſly to them, as if he did from Heaven mention their very Names. Do not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert or turn off the Word to others. Do not think that a Portion is divided to them, but not to thee; that their Conditions are pointed at, their Sins reproved, but not thine. As Pictures in a Room do ſeem to look on every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whoſe Eye is fixed on them. So we ſhould Account, that the Word of the Son of God hath a particular A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect on us, that it directs our Hearts into the Love of God, that it guides our Feet into the ways of Peace; it ſpeaks to all that hear it. We ſhould account that what is written, is written for our Learning; and what is ſpoken, is ſpoken for our Practice.</p>
            <pb n="65" facs="tcp:95520:37"/>
            <p n="3">3. Obey the Son of God, hear his voice preſently, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.7. <hi>To day if you will hear his voice harden not your Hearts;</hi> excuſes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays will harden the Heart; Audience and Obedience ſhould be preſently yeilded and rendred Jeſus Chriſt; we muſt not put off, adjourn our Obedience to a longer day, or to years hereafter to come; <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>He conſidered his ways, and turned his Feet to God's Teſtimonies, he made haſt, and delayed not to keep his Commandments,</hi> Pſal. 119.59, 60. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> when they were Enlightned, Convinced, Converted, they Exhort, they Incourage one another, <hi>Zech.</hi> 8.21. the Inhabitants of one City ſhall go to another, ſaying, <hi>Let us go ſpeedily to Pray before the Lord, and to ſeek the Lord of Hoſts: I will go alſo;</hi> thoſe that are ſenſible of their Duty and Danger, cannot defer, or put off the great concernment of their Souls any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.17. it is ſaid to <hi>Zion, Thy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhall make haſt,</hi> that is, <hi>to joyn themſelves to Chriſt and his Church:</hi> This haſt is ſet down by many Similitudes in Scripture; it is ſaid, <hi>The Gentiles ſhould as waters Flow to the Mountain of the Lords Houſe,</hi> Iſa. 2.23. Tho Waters they do run downwards na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, yet the Nature and motion of the Heathen Nations ſhould be ſo chang'd, that they ſhould run upwards, aſcend the holy
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95520:38"/>Hill of God, the Nations ſhould flow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is ſaid, The <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould run to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.55. <hi>Behold thou ſhalt call a Nation that thou knoweſt not, and Nations that knew not thee ſhall run unto thee becauſe of the Lord thy God, and for the Holy one of Iſrael, for he hath Glorified thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It is ſaid, that the Converted <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould fly to the Church, <hi>Iſa</hi> 60.8. <hi>Who are theſe that fly as a Cloud, and as the Doves to their Windows:</hi> How ſwiftly do the Clouds move, when driven by the Wind? How ſwiftly do the Doves fly when pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by the Hawk, or any other Bird of prey; ſo convinced, and awakened Spirits will fly from the wrath that is to come, and will fly for refuge to take hold of the hope ſet before them, <hi>Matt.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. Are your Souls ſick? Are your wounds bleeding? Are your Conſciences burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Are your Hearts broken? And can you delay turning to Jeſus Chriſt preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? O! conſider how great that Perſon is that ſpeaks to you, it is the Prince of Life, the King of Glory, and is he to be ſhut out, or put off till a longer time. O! think how great matters Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaks, and treats about; is Reconciliation to God, eſpouſals to Chriſt, cutting off the Entail
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95520:38"/>of the Curſe, reverſing the Sentence of Death, and ſetling upon you an eternal Inheritance, ſmall matters; Are they unneceſſary, or inconſiderable things, that you ſhould delay to mind them till here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after? Is it not great mercy that the Son of God will open his Mouth? He might have kept ſilence towards us, as he doth to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nations of the World at this day. Why ſhould we be Viſited, when others are paſſed by, and neglected? Why ſhould the Son of God come to, and knock at our Doors, when he is far off from others, and makes no Addreſs to them? And will you ſlight, and abuſe Chriſts Kindneſs? Will you break off the Treaty of Peace, and reject the offers of Mercy? If you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, Jeſus Chriſt may withdraw, he may utterly depart from you, the Bridegroom may no more woo you; the Phyſitian may no more offer his Help to you, but ſuffer you to die of your Diſeaſes; the great Shepherd may break his Staff of Beauty, take no more care of you, but leave you to be a prey to Satan that roaring Lion. O! conſider if you delay, and put Chriſt off, Sickneſs may ſuddenly ſeize you, Death may in a moment ſnatch you away, your Flower may ſoon Fade, your Lamp of Life be quickly blown out, an
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95520:39"/>Apoplexy may ſurprize you, your Reaſon may be Clouded, your Underſtanding darkned, your Speech may fail you, ſome ſudden accident (that you never thought of) may cut off your Life in an inſtant; will not your delays then be pernitious and fatal to you? What then will become of all your Promiſes, and all your purpoſes to Believe, Repent, and turn to God? Will not Satan then catch away the Soul to Hell? Will you not then fall into the Hands of the <hi>Living God?</hi> Will you not be the objects of his Eternal Frowns and Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? Will you not then too late un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand your Folly and Madneſs in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off Jeſus Chriſt? O! will not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience then twit, upbraid, reproach you? what did you think it was too ſoon to be Cured of your Diſeaſes? Was it too ſoon to have your Bonds, and Satans ſnares broken? Was it too ſoon to be made wiſe? Too ſoon to be ſet at liberty? Too ſoon to be Pardoned? Too ſoon to return from your wanderings, and get into the way of Salvation and Eternal Life? How did Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan blind your Eyes? How did Sin charm and bewitch your Souls? You that once thought it too ſoon, do now underſtand and feel that it is too late: It is a very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable Sentence in <hi>Cyprian, Sero credunt in
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95520:39"/>aeternam paenam, <note place="margin">Contra Demetr.</note> qui noluerunt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere ad aeternam vitam.</hi> Thoſe too late will believe the truth of Gods word to their Eternal Puniſhment, who would not timely believe to their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life; they that would not ſee their Danger, ſhall ſee their Deſtruction: They that would not fear the Threatnings of Gods Mouth, ſhall feel the Blows of his Hand, Is it not better to hear now the ſweet noiſe of the Bridegroom, than here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to hear the terrible Voice of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and Condemning Judg. Take heed that you be not Cheated and Beguiled by Satan; he tells thee thou maiſt liſten to Chriſt, and Repent hereafter; but his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is to harden thy Heart, and that thou ſhalt never liſten, or turn to Chriſt. As the <hi>Levite</hi> roſe early to go his Journey, <hi>Judges</hi> 19.5. but his Father in Law incouraged him to ſtay, and comfort his Heart with a morſel of Bread, and afterward he ſhould go his way; ſo Satan, and ſin are firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt in their Temptations, and Suggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; They tell ſinners they need not riſe early, and ſoon ſet out in the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? That it is beſt firſt to Comfort their Hearts with the Pleaſures and Enjoyments of the World: after they have Eaten a Morſel, and Drunk a Draught of Stolen
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95520:40"/>Waters, they may go on in their way to another World, and as the <hi>Levites</hi> Father in Law that firſt asked but for the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, afterward deſires the whole day, and would have the <hi>Levite</hi> tarry all Night, and ſo he did; even thus Sin and Satan deal with wicked men after they have prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them to miſ-ſpend, and vainly Conſume the Morning of their Lives, they afterwards inſinnate, deſire and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the whole Day of Life to be ſpent in Eſtrangement from God, in the ſervice of vile Affections and baſe Luſts; ſo that the Night of Death comes on them, and they drop down into the bottomleſs Pit; The <hi>Levite,</hi> tho he did not depart and journey one day, yet he might Travel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the next; but when our one day of Life is paſt, and ſpent in ſin, there is no day of Life or Grace that will ſucceed to amend our Folly, or repair our loſs;

And what inheritance of the Almighty from on high? Is not Deſtruction to the Wicked? And a strong puniſhment to the Workers of Iniquity?</hi> God will magnify his Righteouſneſs in feeding Sinners with the Fruits of their own ways, and doings, and in adjudging them to their proper place, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.25. <hi>Judas</hi> is ſaid to go to his own place; the place his Sins had beſpoken,

How dreadful is this for God to Illuſtrate his Juſtice, and Magnify his Wrath in their Eternal Miſery? How Terrible is it for God to get him Honour, by Wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eternally the Heads and Hearts of Sinners, to Exalt himſelf by throwing them down into the bottomleſs Pit, in ſtriking and ſuppreſſing them, in conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and preſerving them at once, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a bare ſtock of being, that he may Graft Eternal Torments on? Will not this be exceedingly diſhonourable, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous to Creatures, that they did not pay God any Rent, Service or Obedience, but neceſſitated their great Land-lord to Diſtrain on them, and make diſtreſs, and take up their Souls and Bodies both in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution? Will not this be an Everlaſting reproach, that they Robbed God of his

That they would give him no Glory as they ought, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.16. but left God to get Honour on them as he could.

As in Heaven there will ſtill be freſh Viſions of Glory, ſo in Hell there will ſtill be new Scenes of Miſery; and how Terrible is this Expreſſion, <hi>a Lake of Fire?</hi> A Lake that will never Ebb, never ſink, never dry away; this Lake will be as broad, as deep, as hot and ſcorching to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, as it was the firſt moment ſinners were caſt into it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Sinners ſhall be deprived of what they would poſſeſs and enjoy, what God threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens <hi>Babylon</hi> with ſhall be fulfilled to them, and executed on them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.14. All the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95520:43"/>things that their Souls Luſted after, ſhall depart from them; all that is delicate and dainty ſhall depart from them, and they ſhall find them no more for ever; all the Lamps whereby they did drive away the Darkneſs and Terror of their Night, ſhall be put out, their Ciſterns ſhall be broken, their Paradiſe of Earthly Pleaſures and Delights ſhall be utterly and eternally bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, the Breaſts of Creatures ſhall be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from their Mouths, and all their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols for ever ſnatch'd out of their Arms, a great part of their <hi>Hell</hi> ſhall be drawn out of, and from that which once was their <hi>Heaven;</hi> this ſhall laſh and ſcourge their Souls, to think of the Mercies they enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and abuſed; to remember the good things that they received from God, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and turned againſt God; that they fed their Luſts with what ſhould have fuel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their Love; thoſe Gifts inticed their Hearts from God, which ſhould have drawn them to him. <hi>Dives</hi> in Hell com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the pain of Senſe, but hath no relief; <hi>Abraham</hi> minds him of the pain of Loſs, and ſo augments his miſery, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.24, 25. <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid, <hi>Son, remember that thou in thy Life time receivedſt thy good things;</hi> as if <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould ſay, Thou hadſt all thoſe <hi>good things</hi> which thou didſt eſteem
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95520:44"/>and value, that thou didſt deſire and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in, that thou didſt love and doat on; thou hadſt thy choice, thou didſt poſſeſs the Prize thou didſt run for; but now thy Days of Pleaſure are at an end, thy Sun of Proſperity is ſet; Thou haſt <hi>no wrong,</hi> yea, God is highly Righteous in his Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards thee; he withholds ſpiritual and eternal Mercies, that thou didſt never deſire, but always deſpiſe, and ſnarches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Temporal Enjoyment, which thou didſt ever Idolize.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Sinners ſhall feel, ſuffer, endure what they Loath, and Abhor; <hi>Job</hi> complains <hi>that the things that his Soul refuſed to touch, were his ſorrowful meat,</hi> Job 6.7. So the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Hell may renew, and take up this doleful complaint, that they muſt feed on that Wormwood and Gall, that they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor, and drink the Wine of the wrath of God, that they loath, that Food is provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them, that they have the greateſt averſation from; that Cup is reached out to them, that they have the greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of; they ſhall be filled with their own ways, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.14. Eat the Fruit of their own doings, and Drink the Wine of the Wrath of the Almighty, <hi>Job</hi> 21.20. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.10. All deadly Poyſons, all fatal Ingredients ſhall be tempered together,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:95520:44"/>and meet in their Cup, containing Red Wine, and full of Mixture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.8. All the Evils that may Enebriate, intoxicate and overcome the Spirits of Sinners, are to be found in this Cup; yet in another Senſe, <hi>it is</hi> Wine without <hi>Mixture, Rev.</hi> 14.10. Not any Tincture, not any drop of Mercy, but it is pure Wrath; theſe Evils will be ſo bitter, ſo grievous, ſo terrible, that perſons will be a burden to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>Job</hi> 7.20. When God made <hi>Job</hi> his mark, and ſhot the Arrows of Temporal Evils againſt him, he complains <hi>he was a burden to himſelf;</hi> How then will ſinners be a burden to themſelves, when the Arrows of the Almighty ſhall Pierce them, when the Poyſon of them ſhall drink up their Spirits; when the Terrours of God ſhall ſet themſelves in Battle array againſt them, <hi>Job</hi> 6.4. If <hi>Job</hi> did loath Life becauſe it was ſo much imbittered with Temporal Afflictions, <hi>Job</hi> 7.16. How much more ſhall ſinners in Hell loath their own being, when embittered with Eternal Evils?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Hell may well be called a Priſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that men ſhall be confined at home, and ſhall be impriſoned in the preſence of an Angry Revenging God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sinners ſhall be ſhut up in themſelves. It is the great ſin of the Children of Men,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:95520:45"/>that they ſtray, wander from themſelves, dwell continually abroad; the Prodigal, when he went into a far Country, he did not only depart from his Father, but alſo wander from himſelf: The firſt ſtep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Recovery was to come to himſelf, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.13, 14, 17. So it will be the Sinners Puniſhment to dwell at home, to be confined to himſelf, to have his Thoughts Eternally fixed on his own Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Iniquity, to conſider of the wrong ſteps he took, the corrupt fruit he brought forth, the debts he contracted, the ſeeds of miſery he ſowed, the Eternal Wrath he provoked, that tho he was admoniſhed of his ſin, and warned of his danger; yet he would not be diverted, he could not be reclaimed; that he would not give Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Maker, yet liſtened to his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; that the Door of his Heart was ſhut againſt Chriſt, yet open to Satan and the World. Sometimes Magiſtrates do Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Offenders to keep their own homes, and Impriſon them in their own Houſes, that they are not to ſtep out, or ſtir a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad: Even ſo the Great and Juſt God will ſhut up ſinners in themſelves; will turn their Eyes inward, and will fix their Thoughts on their ſhameful Nakedneſs, their Monſtrous Uglineſs, their loathſom
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95520:45"/>Deformity; God threatens the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they ſhould take their Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in themſelves, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.26. this will be Eminently and Signally fulfilled in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other World; then Sinners ſhall take their Inheritance in themſelves, their own ways and doings ſhall procure the greateſt evils to them; their own backſlidings ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them; their own wickedneſs ſhall laſh them to Eternity; their Accuſations, their Upbraidings, their Reproaches ſhall be from within; their own Conſciences ſhall fly in their Faces, charge their Sins, bind their Iniquities on them; Condemn them for their Ingratitude, and Enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God. The Lord tells ſinners, <hi>He will reprove them, and ſet their Iniquities in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before them,</hi> Pſal. 50.21. This is a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful word, I will ſet in order before you, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the word hath two Senſes in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> that are pertinent in this place, to ſet in order a Cauſe that is to be Argued, or Pleaded, <hi>Job</hi> 13.18. <hi>Behold now I have ordered my Cauſe;</hi> So God will order his Cauſe when he is to Accuſe, and Plead againſt Sinners; He will detect their Enmities, rip up their Abomination, exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly order all matters that Evidence their Guilt, that may ſhut their Mouths, and ſhame their Faces. 2. The word Signifies
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:95520:46"/>to order a Battel, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.9, 10. <hi>Joab did put his Army in Aray,</hi> every Troop and Company hath their ground appointed, every Soldier his place fixed in which he is to Fight; It is dreadful when God draws together Troops of Childiſh Sins, Legions of Youthful Luſts, Brigades or Battalians of Tranſgreſſions committed in Riper Years, when God will ſet all theſe in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Array againſt the Soul, and will Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them all to give a fierce onſet, a <hi>Furious</hi> Charge on it: O! How terrible will it be when God ſhall at ſeveral times pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them to View, and bring them to the remembrance of a Guilty Creature, when they ſhall be ſo ſet in order, that the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner cannot but behold them, cannot but think on them, cannot turn away his Eye from this Formidable, and dreadful Hoſt of his Iniquities; the Eye of the Soul ſhall be opened, and never cloſe again; The Sinner ſhall awake, and never doze, never be ſtupified, never ſleep again, but ſhall Eternally dwell upon the Sight, and ſenſe of what he hath done againſt, and deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sinners ſhall be impriſoned in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of an angry God. This may ſeem ſtrange, that God's Preſence ſhould be <hi>Hell</hi> to the Damned, that is <hi>Heaven</hi> to the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:95520:46"/>yet thus it ſhall be: It is threatned as a dreadful Evil to <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> that his Eyes ſhould behold the Eyes of the King of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, Iſa</hi> 32.4. <hi>Zedekiah</hi> had dealt perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and treacherouſly with the King of <hi>Babylon;</hi> he had broken his Oath with him and rebelled againſt him: But have not ſinners done worſe? have they not broken repeated Promiſes, and falſified their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God? have they not back-ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from him with a perpetual back-ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding? have they not held faſt their deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and refuſed to return to him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.5. have they not been hardened in their Enmity, and perſiſted to run aſtray, and to go a whoring from God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.27. and O how terrible will God's Face, how dreadful will God's Preſence be to them? I have been credibly informed of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that had proſtituted, and defiled her ſelf in her Husband's Abſence beyond Sea, and was with Child by her Adultery, that hearing that her Husband was arrived, and ready to land, did hang her ſelf, that ſhe might not ſee his Face, whom ſhe had ſo highly offended, ſo bitterly provoked by her Adultery? How then will Spiritual Harlots, and Adulterous Souls Endure to ſee the Face of God, and to behold his angry Countenance to Eternity: O! how
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:95520:47"/>bitter will it be to them to be confined to the Thoughts of their Rebellion, and Gods Enmity againſt them for it? The thoughts of God now are very unpleaſant, and very unwelcome to Sinners, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.28. They like not to retain God in their Knowledg. It was burdenſome to them to acknowledg there was a God; and it was bitter to them to think of this God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.9. God is not in all their thoughts, they baniſh God as much as is poſſible, out of their minds, they forget him as much as they can, they cannot think of God but as a <hi>Law Giver,</hi> that forbids their <hi>Lusts,</hi> and <hi>Actions;</hi> and as a Judg that holds them guilty, and threatens them with Eternal Puniſhments; therefore they ſay to God himſelf, and to the Thoughts of God, <hi>Depart from us, Job</hi> 12.14, 15. they would not ſuffer ſuch Thoughts to break in upon them, to lodg or ſtay with them, becauſe they begin their Hell, and anticipate their Torments before the time; yet tho it be ſo greivous to ſinners to remember <hi>God,</hi> to have their Thoughts fixed, to have their Minds dwell on <hi>God;</hi> yet they muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, they muſt Converſe with this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry <hi>God</hi> for ever. O! what a doleful, dreadful Priſon will it be when a guilty Creature, and an angry <hi>God</hi> ſhall be alone
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:95520:47"/>together. Sinners now have their diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements, they drink deep draughts of the Pleaſures of Sin, of the Wine of Senſual Delights, that they may forget their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and ſhake off the thoughts of a Final Account, of a Righteous Condemnation, and of an Everlaſting Deſtruction; but in this Priſon they can no more ſteep their Souls in Pleaſures, nor ſoak them in Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Delights; all the Comforts of the World are gone, but ſin remains, guilt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides, Conſcience can never be Charmed, Silenced, or ſuppreſſed: When ſinners lye down among Thorns of Terrours, and in Sheets of Flames; when they make their Bed in Hell, Behold <hi>God</hi> is there! <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.3. This is an awakening, a dreadful Behold. O think on it, behold <hi>God</hi> is in Hell! There he meets Sinners with a frowning Face, with a puniſhing Hand; behold <hi>God</hi> is there to remember Iniquity againſt men, to bind the yoke of their Tranſgreſſions on them: This will moſt ſurpriſe and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh; this will moſt diſmay, ſink, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm the Damned to meet with a <hi>God</hi> they have ſo wearied, ſo grieved, ſo vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo burdened with their Iniquities; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold <hi>God</hi> is there, but it is ſtill to fill their Cup of wrath, to deal out blows, and give wounds to them by his Almighty Power!
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95520:48"/>Behold <hi>God</hi> is there, and doth unveil his rowning Face to ſcorch them, and make bare his glorious Arm to deſtroy them.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing that I propoſed to ſpeak to is, <hi>That the Spirits of Sinners, when they go out of the Body, ſhall be caſt into, and ſhut up in Gods Priſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Scripture confirms this truth in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places, <hi>The rich man is ſaid to die, and in Hell he lifted up his Eyes, being in Torments,</hi> Luke 16.22, 23. No ſooner was his Soul out of the Tabernacle of the Body, but it was in the Priſon of Hell. So <hi>Judas</hi> is ſaid to go to his own place, when he paſſed into the Regions of Darkneſs, and of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, <hi>Acts</hi> 25. The filthy <hi>Sodomites,</hi> after their Bodies were burnt with a Temporal Fire, their Souls were Tormented in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Fames, <hi>Judes</hi> Epiſtle 7. <hi>He that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth out of the way of underſtanding, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the Congregation of the Dead;</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; the word ſignifies <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants;</hi> ſome have thought that Hell is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Congregation of the <hi>Giants;</hi> there were <hi>Giants</hi> before the Flood, <hi>Gen</hi> 6.4. as they were of High Stature in Body, ſo they were no Dwarſs in Sin and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; their Iniquities grew to ſo great a Height, that God was provoked to ſend a deſtroying Flood; theſe <hi>Giants</hi> were not
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:95520:48"/>only drowned in the Waters, but alſo ſwallowed up of Eternal Death. Theſe were ſuch heinous Sinners, that they ſeem to be preſented as chief Proprietors, and Principal Poſſeſſors, and Inhabitants of Hell.</p>
            <p>I ſhall endeavour to Demonſtrate to you, that it muſt needs be ſo, That the Souls of wicked Men when they go out of the Body, do paſs into a Priſon: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Here in this World they do caſt off all reſtraints, they are all for Carnal Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, they exempt themſelves from Gods Juriſdiction; they count their Hearts their own, they will Love and Luſt as they pleaſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. Their Abominations were according as they Loved. Sinners reckon their Tongues to be their own, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.4. <hi>Our Lips are our own, Who is Lord over us?</hi> Therefore they will Talk, and ſpeak as they pleaſe. The ten Tribes are called <hi>Aholah, Ezek.</hi> 23.4. as much as to ſay, <hi>her Tent,</hi> becauſe that <hi>Iſrael,</hi> like an Adulterous Wife, left the Houſe of God, her Lawful Husband, forſook him, and repaired to her own Tent Idolatrous <hi>Iſrael</hi> built high places, ſet up Temples in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel;</hi> theſe were the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> own Tents; they did break off from Gods Temple, they thought it Bondage and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95520:49"/>Slavery to be tied to Worſhip in Gods Houſe, they would Offer their Sacrifice in their own Tent. The Prodigal thought himſelf not a Freeman while he was under his Fathers Eye and Government; he would not depend on him for Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or be controuled by his Authority, or Subject to his Commands; he would have his Portion in his own <hi>Hands,</hi> and Live of himſelf; ſo he gathered together all that his Father gave him, and depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a far Country, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.12, 13, 14. There he lived according to his own <hi>Luſts,</hi> and liking; he waſtes his Fathers Goods, keeps bad Company, and indulgeth his vile affectiones to the height. So Sinners carry it as if they were not under Gods Eye, or Subject to his Authority, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.5. It is ſaid of the great Men, <hi>That they alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether broke the Yoke, and burſt the Bonds.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.23. <hi>The Kings of the Earth did ſet themſelves, and take Counſel together againſt the Lord, and against his Anointed,</hi> ſaying, <hi>let us break their Bands aſunder, and caſt away their Cords from us.</hi> Tho Jeſus Chriſt came as a Redeemer to ranſom, and as a Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to reſcue Souls from Slavery; yet they took up ſuch wrong Notions, ſuch hard Thoughts of him, as if he came to chain and fetter them, to yoke and enſlave them,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:95520:49"/>to ſpoil them of the Pleaſure, and deprive them of the liberty of their lives. <hi>Hoſe</hi> tells us, that <hi>the Princes of Judah were like thoſe that remove the bound,</hi> Hoſ. 5.10. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners will not be reſtrained and limited by Gods Bounds, or be held by his Bonds, or bare his yoke. Our firſt Parents affected inordinate <hi>Liberty,</hi> to caſt off all reſtraints, to remove all bounds, to be lawleſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent, tho this indeed be Monſtrous to have the limited Nature of a Creature, and yet the boundleſs unlimited will of God. Our firſt Parents thought to change their Tenure, and of Tenants to become abſolute <hi>Lords;</hi> They denied God that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Quit Rent that he reſerved to himſelf, and invaded the Fruit of that Tree, that he reſtrained them from; that Carnal <hi>Liberty</hi> that Sinners ſo much hunt after, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire to, is a ſtream from this Poyſoned Fountain, and pernitious Fruit from this corrupt root; their degenerate Children have all like ſheep, gone aſtray, and have turned aſide into their own way, <hi>Iſa</hi> 53.6. <hi>yea, they love to wander,</hi> Jer. 14.18. <hi>They chooſe their own ways, and their Soul delights in their Abominations, Iſa.</hi> 66.3. <hi>They think God a poor Master that can do little for them,</hi> Job 22.14, 15. Job 22.17. What can the Almighty do for them? <hi>They account him a hard Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:95520:50"/>that requires too much of them,</hi> Matt. 25.24. I knew thou waſt a hard Man, <hi>Reaping where thou haſt not ſown, and gathering where thou haſt not ſtrowed, Men affect a broad way, a wide Gate, tho it tend to Deſtruction,</hi> Matt. 7.13. They cannot Endure the <hi>Girdle</hi> of <hi>Gods Covenant,</hi> or the <hi>Bond</hi> of his <hi>Laws;</hi> and therefore how juſt a Puniſhment is it that thoſe ſhould be caſt into <hi>Gods</hi> Priſon, that have caſt off his Yoke? How Righteous is <hi>God</hi> in puniſhing ſinful <hi>Carnal Liberty,</hi> with Eternal Bondage and Confinement.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sinners are Criminals, and Debtors, and in both reſpects do deſerve a Priſon.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Wicked Men are Criminals; they rob God, they withold his due, they uſurp his Rights. It is ſaid of Jeſus Chriſt, that he reſtored what he took not away; This was propheſied and ſpoken of our Surety, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.4. If he did not take away from God, who did it? Surely ſinful Man did take away from God; he robb'd God of his Truſt, of his Love, of his Religious Worſhip; He alienated himſelf from God, he withdrew and eſtranged all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from God. Men ſhould have been firſt Fruits devoted to God, and as living Sacrifices offered to him; In this reſpect God may charge the whole World, as of Old he did charge the whole Nation of the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:95520:50"/>
               <hi>Jews, Mal.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Ye have robbed me in Tyths and Offerings.</hi> O how many Thieves are there in the World, that rob God both of the Seventh of their Time, in profaning of his <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and of the Tenth of their <hi>Goods?</hi> They care not how little they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend to maintain <hi>God's Service,</hi> and to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his Worſhip in the World; do they not daily rob <hi>God</hi> of their precious <hi>thoughts,</hi> and of their <hi>choiceſt affections?</hi> They ſet up their own ends, and exalt their own Wills, and do not make <hi>God's Will</hi> their Sovereign Law, <hi>his Glory</hi> their Supream End; How many Families <hi>rob God of his Worſhip</hi> every day? There is no praying to him, no calling upon him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.4. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. <hi>laſt.</hi> All their Life is the ſowing of <hi>Mammon,</hi> the pleaſing themſelves, the gratifying their own Luſts and Vile Affections; Is it ſcandalous to ſteal from Men, and is it not more heinous to rob <hi>God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Men are Enemies to, and rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>God,</hi> Col. 21. <hi>You that were Strangers and Enemies in your minds through wicked works.</hi> Sinners are <hi>Strangers to God, they do nothing to oblige him:</hi> they are <hi>Enemies to God,</hi> they do much to <hi>provoke him;</hi> they are <hi>Enemies againſt God in their minds;</hi> it is an hearty, a deep rooted Enmity; their Minds are ſtill intent on Evil Works. The Apoſtle ſeems
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:95520:51"/>to me to glance at, and have reſpect to thoſe words of <hi>God</hi> recorded by <hi>Moſes, Gen.</hi> 16.5. the Lord ſaw that the <hi>Imaginations of the Thoughts of Man's Heart were only evil continually.</hi> And Men expreſs their <hi>Enmity to God</hi> by their Rebellion againſt <hi>God.</hi> Hear how God accuſeth <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and complaineth againſt them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Hear, O Heavens, and give ear, O Earth, I have nouriſhed, and brought up Children, and they have rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me.</hi> God calls in the whole Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſummons all the Creatures to give in Evidence, and to be Witneſſes againſt them; the Sun, Moon and Stars did run their Race, and afford Light and Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces continually to them; the Earth did bear them, and bring forth Fruit to ſupply their Wants, and continue their Lives. God made ſo many Servants above, and below to miniſter to Man, yet this proud un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Creature withdraws his Service from <hi>God,</hi> denies Obedience to his Maker: Oh hear, and be aſtoniſhed, both Heaven and Earth, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> that I have adopted, the <hi>Jews</hi> that I have nouriſhed, taught, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducated as my Children, yet have made void my Laws, and rebelled againſt me: Princes have Priſons for Thieves and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels againſt them, and ſhall not the King of the whole World have a Priſon for
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:95520:51"/>thoſe that rob him, and rebel againſt him. Rebellion againſt <hi>God</hi> is far worſe than a Rebellion againſt any <hi>Earthly King;</hi> for <hi>God</hi> is an Infinite, and an Eternal Being; he gave us Life, Breath, and all things; his Laws are all righteous, his Commands are holy; they ask but for the Rights of a <hi>God:</hi> They are juſt, they demand but what we owe our Neighbour; they are good for our ſelves, <hi>in the keeping of them is great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> Pſal. 19.11. The Apoſtle commends the Law, and ſaith, <hi>the Command is Holy, Juſt and Good.</hi> Theſe are Three weighty, comprehenſive Epithites. When we yeild <hi>God</hi> his Right, we reap Benefit to our ſelves, juſt as the Trees that ſerve us in bringing forth Fruit, do alſo ſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in bringing forth a Stone or Kernel, to continue their own Kind. Obedience to <hi>God</hi> is grounded on our very Nature, and founded in our very Being. Thoſe that have received a Being from <hi>God's Hand,</hi> ſurely ought to receive a Law from his Mouth. Rebellion againſt <hi>God</hi> therefore muſt needs be an heinous Crime, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve an Eternal Priſon. Thoſe that ſerve their own Luſts, and do Satan's Will in time, are worthy to ſuffer <hi>God's</hi> Will to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>

            <p n="3">3. Sinners are guilty of Spiritual Whoredom and Adultery, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.27. <hi>Thou haſt deſtroyed ſuch as go a whoring from thee. Ye Adulterers and Adultereſſes, know you not that the Friendſhip of this World is Enmity with God? James</hi> 4.14. As a Rebellious Son was by <hi>God's Law to be ſtoned to Death, Deut.</hi> 21.20, 21. ſo a <hi>Woman guilty of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and the Adulterer, were both to be put to death, by God's Command, Levit.</hi> 20.10. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> gave Sentence againſt <hi>Tamar</hi> for her Whoredom; <hi>Let her be brought forth, and burnt, Gen.</hi> 38.24. If the Rebellion of a Son againſt an Earthly Father, was Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; if bodily Adultery was puniſhed with Death, what then doth Soul-Adultery de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve? <hi>God</hi> is our Lawful Husband, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.5. <hi>Thy Maker is thy Husband.</hi> Yet have not ſinful Souls affected the Bed of a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? have they not turned from <hi>God</hi> after <hi>Creatures?</hi> As Chriſt admoniſhes, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> for living in Adultery, or at leaſt in Fornication, <hi>John</hi> 4.18. <hi>He that thou now haſt, is not thy Husband;</hi> ſo God may charge unconvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men and Women, that they live in Spiritual Adultery, that the object they moſt love and doat on, is not their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Embraces; the Creatures were not made to be Idols to Entice us from God,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:95520:52"/>but are beſtowed as Love tokens to allure our Hearts to God; yet the Hearts of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Sinners do go after their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. And the Hearts of Idolaters do walk after the Heart of their deteſtable things, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.21. tho this was a great cheat, to think that Dead Idols, or falſe <hi>Gods</hi> had a heart to retaliate their Love, or to Requite them for their Worſhip; on this Account <hi>God</hi> is the only Lawful Husband, and meer object of our Love, becauſe he hath a Heart to Love us again, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.17. I love thoſe that love me; Idols or Creatures cannot ſay ſo; Dead Idols, and Dead Creatures have no Heart to love us. O! conſider then what a horrid Crime Spiritual Adultery is; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we defile the Creatures, do offer Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to them, and put a Rape on them; they call and invite us to the Love of <hi>God,</hi> they entice us not to the ſinful, and inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate love of themſelves. It is mens Luſt that is active in this Adultery, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is only Paſſive, it groans under this Force put on it, but cannot decline and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it; the Creature is innocent, but it is a Mans Unchaſt and Filthy Heart that is guilty. For this Spiritual Whoredom men deſerve to be caſt into <hi>Gods Priſon;</hi> if <hi>God</hi> be broken by their whoriſh Heart, <hi>Ezek</hi> 6.9.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:95520:53"/>then ſurely they are worthy to be wounded, and broken for it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Men are debtors to <hi>God,</hi> every ſin is a Debt, <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Forgive us our Debts, as we forgive our Debtors;</hi> we primarily owe to <hi>God</hi> a Debt of Love, and Obedience; but for default in the Payment of this Debt, there ariſes another Debut, we owe <hi>God Glory</hi> to be raiſed out of our Sufferings, Eternal Miſery and Torments; all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures muſt bow to <hi>God,</hi> and ſome way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſerve him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.32. Either as Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Honour, or as Veſſels for Diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; <hi>God</hi> muſt have glory either by his Mercy, or our Miſery; it is but juſt that <hi>God</hi> ſhould enter his Action againſt his Debtors, that he ſhould Sue, Arreſt and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon them. If thoſe that owe Mony to Men, and do not pay it, are caſt into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; much more thoſe that owe Service, and Obedience to God, and not render it, are to be thrown into an Eternal Priſon.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Sinners are now already in Priſon, they are called Priſoners, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24.6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.9. they are Styled Captives, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1. they are ſaid to be taken Captive by the Devil at his will, and to be held in his Snare; they are in the Bond of Iniquity, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.23. <hi>The Sins of Men do take them, and their iniquities do hold them,</hi> Prov. 5.22. we read
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:95520:53"/>that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were caſt into the inner Priſon, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.24. This Expreſſion of the Inner Priſon, implies the Priſon was divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into two parts; there was an outer, and an inner Priſon; ſo I may diſtinguiſh, God hath an outer and inner Priſon; his outer Priſon is in this World, his inner Priſon is in Hell; here ſinners are in the outer Priſon, <hi>they are bound,</hi> Iſa 61.1. <hi>they are held,</hi> Rom. 7.6. <hi>They are taken captive,</hi> 2 Tim. 2 laſt. <hi>They are ſhut up under ſin,</hi> Gal. 3.22. <hi>Loaden with Dead Works,</hi> Heb. 9.14. <hi>Guilty before God,</hi> Rom. 3.19. <hi>And Condemned,</hi> John 3.18. He that believes not is Condemned already; and if men ſtay, and continue in the outer-Priſon, and Death finds them here, how juſt is it that God ſhould caſt them into his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Priſon, and ſhut them up, and hold them there for ever.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, when he was a ſurety for Sinners, and ſtood in their room, and ſtead, was made a Priſoner, was under a reſtraint and confinement, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.8 It is ſaid, <hi>He was taken from Priſon and Judgment.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt could not have been taken out of Priſon, if he had not firſt been in Priſon. But how was Jeſus Chriſt in Priſon? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, 1. The great ſorrow that was in, the amazing fear that was on Chriſts Spirit, was as a Priſon about his Soul, <hi>Matt.</hi> 36.37, 38. he was ſorrowful, and very heavy, he ſaid, <hi>My Soul is ſorrowful to the Death. He
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:95520:54"/>was ſore amaz'd, Mark</hi> 14.33. taking a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the dreadful ſtorm that did hang over him, the deep and bitter Cup reach'd out to him. the vaſt Ocean of Sorrows and Sufferings that were before him, <hi>yet he was heard in that he feared,</hi> Heb. 5.7. This implies that he was under fear, yet he was deliver'd from it, that it did not ſink him, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm him. 2. Jeſus fell into the hands of his Enemies, they ſeized on him, led him him away to <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> they held him under their power for ſeveral hours, till they <hi>Condemned</hi> and <hi>Executed</hi> him, <hi>John</hi> 18.12, 13. the Captain and band of Soldiers took Chriſt, bound him, and led him away as a Priſoner. 3. Jeſus was buried, he was laid in the duſt, and ſhut up as a captive of Death in the priſon of the grave; but ſuch was the dignity of his perſon, the value of his Blood, the ſatisfactory, nature of his Suffering, that his Captivity was ſhort, his Impriſonment laſted but a little while; yet this confinement and priſon of Chriſt doth teach us what ſinners deſerve; doth inſtruct us what they muſt expect, if they are not waſhed from their Sins in Chriſts Blood, and reconciled to God by his Death; his Perſon being infinite, and his Sufferings ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory, his Priſon could only be tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary and ſhort; but the nature of Sinners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Finite, and their ſufferings not able to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:95520:54"/>expiate their ſins, their Priſon muſt needs be Everlaſting.</p>
            <p n="5">5. God threatens ſinners with this Priſon, and he muſt needs be juſt to himſelf, and true to his word; the Lightening of Gods Threatning, is not without a Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt of Execution and Vengeance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.17. <hi>The wicked ſhall be turned into Hell, and all the Nations that forget God;</hi> God hath not only ſaid it, but alſo ſworn it, <hi>That he will never forget any of the deeds of impenitent Sinners,</hi> Amos 8.7. the Lord hath Sworn by <hi>the Excellency of Jacob,</hi> that is, by himſelf, that is <hi>Jacobs</hi> Excellency, <hi>ſurely I will never forget any of their Works.</hi> Tho men forget God, and his Laws, yet he will not forget their Crimes and Iniquities. Gods Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning muſt ſtand, therefore ſinners muſt fall into the Bottomleſs Pit: Gods word muſt take hold of them, <hi>Zack.</hi> 1.5, 6. therefore they will be caſt into the Eternal Priſon; <hi>If we confirm not Gods Command by doing it,</hi> Deut. 27. laſt. <hi>God will confirm his threatning by executing it,</hi> Dan. 9.12.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Spirits of Sinners departed out of the Body muſt be ſhut up in Gods Priſon; for God hath mighty Officers of Juſtice, he hath powerful Bayliffs and Serjeants to Arreſt, to Seize on, to carry away depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souls, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.20. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>I have been credible informed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a wicked man that I knew my ſelf, <hi>That when he was on the brink of the Pit, and on the Borders of Eternity; Something in the likeneſs of a Crow appeared in his Chamber, and ſate on the Teſtar of his Bed, and could not be driven away till the ſick man gave up the Ghoſt, and then it ſuddenly Vaniſhed away.</hi> The <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Rabbins</hi> have talked of the <hi>Angel of Death,</hi> that did appear to Sick and Dying Men, and was very Terrible to them; by this Angel of Death they ſeem to mean ſome good or bad Angel ſent to fetch the Soul to God's Tribunal to give its Account, and to receive its final Sentence. <hi>God</hi> doth not want Means, or Meſſengers to attach and apprehend guilty Souls, and to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct them into his Terrible and glorious preſence.</p>
            <p>The 3d. thing I propoſed to ſpeak to, was to ſhew you how dreadful this Priſon is; and that I ſhall open to you in theſe following particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This Priſon is a very dark Priſon, the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:95520:55"/>Scripture calls the darkneſs of it, <hi>outer dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Matt. 8.12. <hi>The Children of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhall be caſt into outer darkneſs,</hi> ſo the unprofitable ſervant is ſentenced to, and ſent into <hi>outer darkneſs,</hi> Matt. 25.30. <hi>Sinners now are in darkneſs,</hi> yea, they are ſaid to be <hi>darkneſs,</hi> Epheſ. 5.8. but this expreſſion points at the inward darkneſs of the minds of Sinners; there is a <hi>Cataract</hi> on the Eye of the Soul, a Veil on the Underſtanding; but there is beſides this inward darkneſs, an outer darkneſs, <hi>when ſinners ſhall be removed at the greateſt distance from God the Father of Lights,</hi> James 1.17. They ſhall be eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeparated, and cut off from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God; <hi>In his light Saints ſhall ſee light,</hi> Pſal. 36.9. <hi>In the light of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, they ſhall ſee the light of Life; but wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men ſhall go to the generation of their ungodly Fathers, they ſhall never ſee the Light,</hi> Pſal. 49.9. <hi>The mist of darkneſs is their portion,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.17. <hi>yea, the blackneſs of Darkneſs is reſerved for them as an eternal inheritance,</hi> Judes <hi>Epiſt.</hi> the 13th v. what Terrour is there in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>The blackneſs of darkneſs. Neither Creatures that Shine as a Candle to them, nor God as a Sun ſhall ariſe on them Luke</hi> paints out the ſadneſs of <hi>Pauls</hi> State, and of thoſe that were in the Ship with him, <hi>Acts.</hi> 17.20. <hi>That no ſmall Tempeſt laid on them, and that neither the Sun nor the Stars for many days ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:95520:56"/>to them.</hi> Thus it ſhall be with the <hi>Damned in Hell,</hi> a dreadful Tempeſt of the wrath of God will lye upon them, and he will never appear as a Sun to chear them, nor ſuffer Creatures as Stars to ſhine for their Comfort; they will be ſhut out from Gods gracious preſence, and alſo ſhut up from the Creatures, they ſhall neither have Beams from <hi>Heaven,</hi> nor Lamps from <hi>Earth,</hi> they ſhall leave all their Idols behind them in the world; they ſhall looſe all their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual pleaſures and delights; God will give them no joy, and Creatures will lend them no comfort, therefore <hi>blackneſs</hi> of <hi>darkneſs</hi> muſt needs follow. <hi>Thick darkneſs that might be felt was one of the plagues of Egypt,</hi> Exod. 21.22, 23. but this laſted but three days, but here is Eternal Darkneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This priſon is a ſtrong priſon, there is no breaking out of it, no Filing off the Chains of the <hi>Damned</hi> or Forcing open the doors, the Judg himſelf by the arm of his own <hi>Omniſciency</hi> is the Keeper of this Priſon; the Eye of his <hi>Omniſciency</hi> ſtill watches over the Priſoners, that there is no flying or eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caping. God challengeth all creatures, <hi>who ſhall deliver out of my hand,</hi> Deut. 32.39. if he do tare in pieces, and deliver up the body to the firſt, and the Soul to the <hi>Second Death;</hi> there will be none to <hi>reſcue</hi> or <hi>deliver, Pſ.</hi> 50.22. <hi>when God ſhuts up, there is no opening,</hi> Job
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:95520:56"/>12.14. Tho there may be millions of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners in Hell, yet this Evidences their weakneſs, and evinces Gods ſtrength, that this huge and vaſt multitude cannot wreſt themſelves ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the Hand of the Judg, or break his Priſon; God that caſt them thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will hold and ſecure them there.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Gods Priſon is a cloſe Priſon; there will be no Addreſſing to, Viſiting or Releiving of his Priſoners, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.26. conſider what <hi>Abraham</hi> there ſpeaks to <hi>Dives, And beſides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, ſo that they that would paſs from hence to you cannot, neither can they paſs to us, that would come from thence.</hi> There is a great gulf that cannot be filled up, or paſſed over, and this gulf is Fixed, it ſhall remain and continue for ever: Gods Decree is Stable, it cannot be changed, revoked, or repealed; there is an unalterable, an eternal ſeparation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>bleſſed</hi> and the <hi>damned;</hi> it is not to be thought that any of the Saints will pity the <hi>Damned,</hi> will relent towards them, or melt over them; Saints that be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and even ſwallowed up in the Love of God, they ſhall fully acquieſs in his will, and rejoyce that his Juſtice is Magnified, and his Power Glorified in the Eternal Deſtruction of the Wicked; but <hi>Abraham</hi> makes only a ſuppoſition; if any ſuch thing were poſſible, if Saints could ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiſe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:95520:57"/>with the Damned, if their Bowels did yearn towards them, if they were will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to relieve them, or to carry over any ſupplies to them, if they did endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to caſe their Pains, or mitigate their Torments; all ſuch deſires would be in vain, all ſuch endeavours would be fruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and inefiectual; they could not get to the Damned, their Kindneſs could not reach them or affect them, all <hi>Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> with them is obſtructed, all paſſages are ſhut up, theſe tormented <hi>Creatures</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible, Saints can carry no water to cool their Tongues, can bring them no <hi>Cordials</hi> to revive their Souls; the <hi>Damned</hi> cannot come forth, nor others come in to them to ſuccour or eaſe them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is an Eternal Priſon, there will be no Goal-delivery, no diſmiſſion or relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of theſe Priſoners. We read in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24, 21.22. of ſome that ſhould be gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and ſhut up in Priſons, but after many days they ſhould be Viſited. <hi>Piſcator</hi> underſtands this of Kings and Princes that ſhould be <hi>Conquered</hi> by the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and held in <hi>Bondage</hi> for many years, but theſe oppreſſed men ſhould at laſt be Viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and releived by the gracious Kingdom of Je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s Chriſt, that ſhould give liberty to their Souls, freedom to their <hi>Conſciences.</hi> But thoſe that God apprehends, and ſhuts
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:95520:57"/>up in his Priſon ſhall never be viſited, and recover their Liberty. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was by the Fury of his Adverſaries caſt into a deep and miery Dungeon, but God rais'd him up Friends; <hi>Ebed-melech</hi> and others did let down Cords into his Dungeon, drew him up, and ſaved his life, <hi>Jer.</hi> 38.10, 11, 12, 13. But no Beam of Hope ſhall ſhine, no Cord of a Promiſe ſhall be let down to the Damned to draw them up out of their Dungeon. It was an Act of Oppreſſion, Cruelty and Tyranny in the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that he opened not the Houſe of his Priſoners, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 14.17. but this is an Act of Pure and High Juſtice in God, that he will never open the Houſe of his Priſoners; they that ſinned without Dread of his Juſtice, ſhall ſuffer without Relief from his Mercy: There is now a Wall of Partition between God and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in this Life, but this may poſſibly be broken down, but there is a Gulf fixed in Hell, that can never be paſſed over. This is dreadful to conſider, that God executes ſinners, and yet they continue his Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to feel more Wrath, and ſuffer more Vengeance; the guilt of ſin ſtill cleaves to them, and the wrath of God will ſtill abide on them, <hi>John</hi> 9. <hi>last, John</hi> 3. <hi>last,</hi> ſin is ſaid to remain, and ſo wrath doth abide. Repentance in Hell will be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:95520:58"/>any Fruit; their Grief without Relief; their Groans, Cries, Petitions will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, can obtain nothing at the Hand of God; ſinners were deaf to God in time, and he will be deaf to them in eternity: Their Hearts were hardned, and his Bowels will be ſhut: The Fewel of Gods Anger will be everlaſting, therefore the Fire will be eternal, an Immortal Death, an ever dying Miſery, and endleſs Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will be the Portion of the Damned. The ſuffering Jews complain, and ſay, <hi>that God had hedged them about, and they could not get out, Lam.</hi> 3.7. ſo the damned in Hell are ſo hedged in by their own guilt, and the juſt wrath of God, that they can never get out: Their Deſtruction will be everlaſting, their Ruin irrecoverable; God will not Releaſe them, and they cannot Reſcue themſelves.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This heightens the Miſery of depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Souls, that their Priſon is a place of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as well as of Reſtraint: <hi>Dives</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains <hi>he was tormented in that Flame, Luke</hi> 16.24. and would have his Brethren warned, <hi>that they might not come into that place of Torments, Luke</hi> 16.25. God will exact his debts of, and execute his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings on ſinners: He will tread them in the Wine-preſs, and preſs out all that is ſweet, grateful and pleaſant, and leave
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:95520:58"/>only a dry Husk of Being: the Damned ſeem to be called Carcaſes, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 66. <hi>laſt. Ye ſhall go forth, and ſee the carcaſes of the men that tranſgreſſed againſt me.</hi> The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is Elegant, Significant and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical: Chriſt will command his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that would not have him to reign over them, to be brought before him; he will ſentence them to be ſlain in his preſence; when they are ſlain, when all the Peace, Joy, Comfort of their Souls is deſtroyed, what will remain but a meer Carcaſe of Being. When men ſhall be only to be miſerable, to endure venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, to ſuffer Torments, this may well be ſtiled a Carcaſe of Being. <hi>Bullinger de Triumph.</hi> tells us, that the day that an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Triumphed, the Priſoners were led in Chains, and expoſed as an open ſpectacle to the Eyes of the Spectators; and that when the Chariot of him that Triumphed, turned to go up to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol, then the Priſoners were led away to the Priſon, and the Triumpher ſtaid in the Capitol, till news was brought him, that the Priſoners, or ſome one of them was put to death in the Priſon; the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon this day was a place of Execution among the <hi>Romans.</hi> Gods Priſon will be a place of Eternal Execution and Torments. <hi>Dives</hi> begged that <hi>Lazarus</hi> might but <hi>dip
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:95520:59"/>the Tip of his Finger in Water, and let fall a few drope to cool his Tongue, Luke</hi> 16.24. his Requeſt ſeems very modeſt, he did not deſire that <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſhould dip his whole Hand, no not his whole Finger, but only <hi>the Tip of his Finger;</hi> this was a very ſmall Petition, yet it is not granted, but rejected and decried. Sinners in Hell ſhall not obtain the leaſt eaſe, refreſhment or mitigation of their Torments. God will deal with ſinners, as they did with Jeſus Chriſt; he cried out, <hi>I Thirſt, John</hi> 19.28. but did he receive any thing to refreſh or eaſe him? no, his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies only filled a Sponge with Vinegar, and put it to his Mouth, <hi>John</hi> 19.30. this was to Torment, rather than Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him. As Chriſt obtained nothing from men to refreſh him, ſo ſinners ſhall get nothing from God to eaſe them; when once they are ſhut up in his Priſon, as the wicked Jews, Prieſts and Scribes upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſt with his words and works, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.40, 41, 42, 43. that he ſaid <hi>he would build the Temple, that he aſſerted himſelf to be the Son of God, that he ſaved others;</hi> ſo a Righteous God, and an Awakened Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will upbraid Sinners with their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil words, and their ſinful actions to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; <hi>the iniquity of their Heels will compaſs them about, the reward of their Hand will be
<pb facs="tcp:95520:59"/>given to them:</hi> Iſaiah 3.10. <hi>they ſhall feed on the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own inventions;</hi> Prov. 1.31. <hi>They that glory in their wiſdoms, and applauded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their inventions,</hi> as of they had found out the true and chief Good, as if they had diſcovered the true Pleaſures, the true Liberty, the true Happineſs, ſhall ſmart for their Inventions, and feel the woful effects of them for ever.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This renders the Condition of thoſe that are in Gods Priſon, terrible, that they are under the fear and dread of future e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and of a more ſevere puniſhment: As the thoughts of the Affizes are bitter and terrible to Malefactors; they know that then their Crimes will be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, accuſations will be formed, Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes will appear againſt them, they will be Condemned and Executed: So ſinners in Hell may dread the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Judgment of the Great Day: Sinners are not yet at the bottom of their Pit, they are not yet fallen under the heavieſt, hotteſt, fulleſt expreſſions of the Wrath of God; they do not yet ſee the worſt of their Condition: It is ſaid <hi>that Death and Hell ſhall be caſt into the Lake of Fire and Brimſtone; this is the ſecond death, Revel</hi> 20.14. What is intended and meant by Death and Hell? I ſuppoſe by Death
<pb facs="tcp:95520:60"/>here, is meant the Body that died, and ſo fell under the power of Death; and Hell here ſignifies the Souls of the Damned that were caſt into Hell: The Continent is put for the thing Contained; the Bodies of the wicked were held under death, and their Souls were ſhut up in Hell, but the Bodies of the Wicked ſhall not ſtill ſleep in the Grave; they ſhall awake and riſe, be joined to, and united with their Bodies; but this reſurrection will not be a benefit, but a hurt to them; it will not be a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge but a puniſhment; their Bodies ſhall riſe that they may fall into the Lake of Fire, that they may feel Torments, that they be obnoxious to puniſhment from the Revenging Hand of God; thoſe that are now in Hell do know that this will be, that their Souls and Bodies muſt meet again, that as they joined in ſin, ſo they may be Companions in miſery; this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction they dread, they would rather their Bodies ſhould dwell in the Grave for ever, than that Soul and Body both ſhould be united to be drowned in a Lake of Fire, to be ſwallowed up of the ſecond Death.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Sinners ſhall have the miſery of their Priſon heightned by theſe two aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 1. They that remember what Mercy was once offered to them, and was rejected by them. 2. They that behold what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs

Sinners ſhall call to mind what means of Grace they once enjoyed, what tenders of Salvation were made to them; the Son of God preached to the old World; he called them to Repentance, he warned them to fly from the Wrath to come; yet their Underſtandings were darkned, their Conſciences ſtupified, their Hearts hardned, their Ears ſtopt; even ſo it hath been ſince, thoſe that have been in the Church, and under the ſound of the Word, have heard tidings that ſhould have affected their Spirits, gladded their Hearts yea, even raviſhed their Souls; a year of Jubilee hath been proclaimed, a day of Salvation hath been afforded; ſinners have been told, that dead Souls may hear the Voice of the Son of God and live; that Priſoners in this World may be ſet free, Captives releaſed, Wounds may be healed, Diſeaſes cured, Sinners may be juſtified in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, filthy Souls may be cleanſed, Conſcience may be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from dead works; yet men mind not, regard not, ſeek not any of theſe things: They make light of all the Travel of Chriſts Soul, of the Purchaſe of his Blood, of the Legacies of his Teſtament, <hi>Matt.</hi> 22.5. they conſider not that their Diſeaſes
<pb facs="tcp:95520:61"/>threaten them with Eternal Death; that the weight of their Guilt will ſink them down into the Bottomleſs Pit; that the ſhame of their Nakedneſs will expoſe them to everlaſting Contempt and Abhorrency; all this Stupidity, Folly and hardneſs of Heart ſhall be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and reflected on as a juſt Cauſe of Eternal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: They ſhall remember, how Jeſus Chriſt called, and they did not anſwer; he knocked, and they did not open; he ſtretched out his Hands filled with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and ineſtimable Gifts, but they did not ſtretch out the hand of Faith to receive Chriſt, and his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits: They would not look to Chriſt that they might be ſaved, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 45.22. They turned from the Captain of Salvation to a Murtherer, from a merciful Shepherd to a cruel and devouring Lion; they would not come to Chriſt that they might have life, <hi>John</hi> 5.40. they would not lean on Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

This will one day ſting them, that ſin was ſweeter to them than ſalvation; that rather than quench the fire of Luſt, they would run into the flames of Hell; that rather than the Old Man ſhould ſuffer, and its Members be mortified or cut off, they themſelves would periſh everlaſtingly: This will to eternity wound them, that their vanity of Mind, their careleſneſs of Spirit, their unbelief, and hardneſs of Heart hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done them; that they dallied, trifled away the time; turned away the Phyſitian, refuſed the Redeemer, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the Bridegroom, and muſt ſuffer the deſerved pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for all this to eternity; they will ſee their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity is loſt, and never to be regained; that the Door of Gods Houſe is ſhut, never to be opened again; that the Treaty of Peace is broken off, never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived any more; that the Ladder that joined Earth and Heaven together is taken away, is drawn up, and will never be let down to ſinners any more.</p>

            <p n="1">1. Are your Eyes opened? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.7. This is the means to bring us out of our ſpiritual Priſon, and the firſt ſtep towards our Liberty. Why are Men ſo quiet, ſo contented, ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied to ſtay in Gods outer Priſon? Surely it is, becauſe their Eyes are ſhut, they diſcern not where they are, and how great their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is. Jeſus Chriſt firſt opens the blind eyes, and then he brings the Priſoners out of the Priſon-Houſe: Inquire therefore, did you ever come to your ſelves, take up true Notions, or form a right Judgment concerning your loſt, deplorable and miſerable Eſtate? <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.17.

If Men did come to themſelves, they would leave Sin as a bad and hard Maſter, and would return to God their Heavenly Father. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of Sinners recovering themſelves out of the ſnare of the Devil, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>laſt.</hi> The Word in the Greek is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. It ſignifies to recover out of Drunknneſs, and to become ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and thoſe that thus become ſober do eſcape
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:95520:64"/>out of the ſnare of the Devil. Sinners are drunken with falſe Notions, with wrong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, and ungrounded Imaginations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning themſelves, the goodneſs of their own Eſtate, the ſweetneſs of the Pleaſures of Sin, the worth of the Riches of the World. Men muſt return to ſobriety of Mind, to a right Judgment of their State and Ways, that they may recover out of the ſnare of the Devil. Are the Scales of Ignorance fallen off from your Eyes, is the Veil drawn off from your Hearts? <hi>Act.</hi> 12.7, 9. <hi>A Light ſhined into</hi> Peters <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and then he was raiſed, and called out of it;</hi> ſo here.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Are you come to Jeſus the Mediator of the New Teſtament, <hi>and to the Blood of ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that ſpeaks better things than the Blood of Abel?</hi> Heb. 12.24. Are you come into his Righteouſneſs? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.27. That is an obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable Phraſe, to come into the Righteouſneſs of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> Believers come into it as their Garment that muſt cloath and cover them, their Fortreſs and City of Refuge, that muſt ſecure them from the Curſe of the Law, and Reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Juſtice.

Are you made Free from the Law of Sin and Death? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. <hi>The Law of the Spirit of Life which is in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made me free from the Law of Sin and Death.</hi> The Law of the Spirit is the mighty, powerful, effectual working of the Spirit of Life. Though the Law of Sin be ſtrong, yet the Law of the Spirit of Life is ſtronger. This Law of the Spirit can prevail and carry it againſt the Law of Sin; have we ever experienced this mighty Law of the Spirit? hath it broke our Fetters and Chains, mortified our Luſts, enlarged our Hearts? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.32. <hi>Then will I run the way of thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, when thou ſhalt enlarge my Heart.</hi> It is the work of the Spirit to enlarge the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding by beaming in new Light, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the Will by kindling new ſpiritual Love; when Chriſt by his Spirit doth cirtumciſe the Heart, then the Chains of Luſt do fall off: <hi>Is the Law of God written in you?</hi> Jer. 31.33. Is this a prevailing, reigning Principle in your Hearts, and as a powerful Byaſs on your Wills? <hi>Do you chooſe the way of Truth, and chooſe Gods Precepts?</hi> Pſal. 119.30, 173.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Have you New, Honourable, and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Chains caſt about your Souls? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.14.

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:95520:65"/>they ſhould come over to her, and after her in Chains. We are not to underſtand the Words as if Chriſt ſhould force Proſelites into his Church, or Subjects into his Kingdom. Jeſus Chriſt never did violence to the Bodies of Men, or by an outward force hale Men to him; but the Phraſe ſignifies the powerful work of Chriſt by his Spirit on the Minds and Conſciences of Men; he caſts Chains of Light and Love about the Souls of Men: He mightily convinces and perſwades them of the Truth of his Doctrine, of the Excellency of his Promiſes: He plants ſtrong Inclinations in them, he makes powerful Impreſſions on them, that they cannot but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject themſelves to him, and yield and ſubmit to his Church.

As Jeſus when he ſtood in the place of Sinners, and aſwered Gods Juſtice for their iniquities, he was deſerted by all his three Diſciples that he took to be with him in his Agony, who fell aſleep; when he was apprehended all his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples forſook him, and fled from him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.40. <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.50.

Gods Priſon is a <hi>reproachful, ignominious</hi> and <hi>infamous</hi> Place: Here Gods Debtors are detained, here his Enemies are confined; this will be an Eternal Diſgrace to the Priſoners, that a patient Creditor was put to arreſt them, that a long-ſuffering God was neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to apprehend and ſhut them up: He hath ſworn that to Him <hi>every Knee ſhall bow,</hi> Iſa. 45.23. And thoſe obſtinate, ſtiff-necked Sinners would not willingly ſtoop to God, would not yield him any ſincere Obedience, therefore God was obliged to bow, to break, to ſtoop them, whether they would or no. To be a Tree for Fruit, is honourable; but for Barrenneſs to be made a Tree for Fuel,

We are <hi>Children of Wrath</hi> by Nature, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. ſo Hell is our Inheritance and Patrimony: We are <hi>Children of Diſobedience,</hi> Eph. 2.2. and ſo Hell is our Purchaſe. God hath been exiled out of our Minds, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.4 and we deſerve to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd out of his glorious Preſence. It is ſaid that <hi>Cain went out from the preſence of the Lord,</hi> Gen. 4.16. and the <hi>Prodigal went into a far Countrey,</hi> Luk. 15.13, 14. Thus Sinners do ſinfully baniſh themſelves from God, and a ſinful Baniſhment doth deſerve and may procure a poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Baniſhment: If every Worker of Iniquity hath bid God <hi>Depart.</hi> Job 21.14, 15, <hi>They ſay to the Almighty, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from us;</hi> then ſurely it is but a juſt Recompenſe for Chriſt to ſay at laſt, <hi>Go ye Curſed into everlaſting Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</hi> Matth. 25 41.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) I ſhall now proceed to ſome <hi>Directions,</hi> how you may eſcape this Priſon.</p>
            <p n="1">1. You muſt <hi>Believe</hi> ſoundly that there is ſuch a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: This Truth muſt be fixed on, and rooted in your Minds; it muſt not be a doubtful Opinion, but a root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Perſwaſion: God is wronged by wicked Men, and he muſt right himſelf; they have <hi>preſſed him with their Iniquities as a Cart is preſſld under the ſheaves,</hi> and he muſt <hi>eaſe</hi> himſelf, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.24. <hi>Ah, I will eaſe me of my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and avenge me of my Adverſaries.</hi> Sinners riſe up proudly againſt God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138.21. <hi>Am I not grieved
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:95520:67"/>with thoſe that riſe up againſt thee?</hi> and God muſt humble and abaſe them: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.29. <hi>Thou ſetteſt them in ſlippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry places, thou caſteſt them down into deſtruction.</hi> Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men break God's <hi>Yoak,</hi> Jer. 5.5. and therefore muſt be broken with that <hi>Rod of Iron</hi> that is in Chriſt's hand, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.9. God will draw near to them in Juſtice, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.5. <hi>I will come near to you to Judgment,</hi> that are <hi>gone far</hi> from God as to Obedience: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.27. <hi>Lo thoſe that are far from thee ſhall periſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Acknowledge that you have <hi>deſerved</hi> to be <hi>thrown</hi> into this Priſon: Have you not lived <hi>without God in the World,</hi> Eph. 2.12. and and ſo have you not begun your Hell on Earth? have you not executed a great and griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous part of the Eternal Puniſhment on your ſelves, by neglecting Converſe with God, and cutting your ſelves off from Communion with him? Have you not content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly been without God in Time, and is it not righteous that you ſhould be without him to Eternity?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Submit to the Spirit of God when it becomes a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Bondage</hi> to your Souls, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.15. It is then a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Bondage, when it arreſts the Conſcience with a deep heavy ſenſe of Sin; when it ſets home the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and Curſe of the Law, when it ſeals to a Sinner a Sentence of Condemnation, and fills the Soul with the Terrors of God: <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. <hi>The Scripture hath conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all under Sin;</hi> the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> might as well be rendred <hi>ſhut up:</hi> The Scripture hath ſhut up all men, and all the Acts of the Natural man under ſin; it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>all things</hi> that appertain and belong to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man, and flow from him: <hi>For they that are in the fleſh, cannot pleaſe God,</hi> Rom. 8.8. <hi>The Sacrifice of the Wicked,</hi> that is, his beſt Religious Service, <hi>is an Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the Lord:</hi> And <hi>the Prayer of the Wicked,</hi> that is, all his common Actions, are alſo <hi>an Abomination to the Lord,</hi> Prov. 15.8, 9. If the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and the <hi>Way</hi> of the Wicked be an Abomination, then the Scripture may well conclude his <hi>All</hi> under Sin. Ungodly men ſeem to walk at Liberty, to be ſecure, merry, and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned at Sin, the Wrath of God, and an Eternal State; but the Spirit of God comes and arreſts ſecure Sinners, and ſhuts them up under the bitterneſs of Sin, and the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:95520:68"/>dreadful ſenſe of the Wrath of God; in this Caſe it is dangerous for Perſons to ſhake off the Terrors of God, to deſpsſe his Threatnnings, and to break God's Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: Thoſe that quench Convictions, and return to a looſe and licentious Life, are in great danger of undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves to Eternity. Be therefore perſwaded, that the Spirit and the Scripture do mercifully ſhut up Unregenerate Men, and all their Actions under ſin; it is not that they may ſink under their Guilt, languiſh under their Diſeaſe, and periſh everlaſtingly; but all this is to humble their proud Minds, and break their hard Hearts, that they may ſue to Free Grace to remit their Debt, break their Chains, heal their Diſeaſe, and ſave their Souls. The Scripture <hi>ſhuts up all under ſin, that the Promiſe by Faith of Jeſus Chriſt might be given to them that believe:</hi> The Spirit of Bondage prepares Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the Spirit of Adoption, that Men may act Faith on Jeſus Chriſt, lay hold of the free Promiſe, and ſo have Juſtification and Salvation as an Alms of Mercy.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Liſten to <hi>Chriſts Voice,</hi> that calls you out of the ſpiritual Priſon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.9. <hi>That thou mayſt ſay to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, Go forth; and to them that are in darkneſs, Shew your ſelves.</hi> O deſire and cry to Jeſus Chriſt to ſpeak this effectually to your Soul: You need he ſhould ſpeak with a <hi>ſtrong hand,</hi> Iſa. 8.11. Look to Jeſus Chriſt to <hi>open the door</hi> of Gods Priſon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1. and alſo to open the door of your <hi>hard heart.</hi> Acts 16.14. God <hi>opened the Heart of Lydia.</hi> O deſire Jeſus Chriſt to ſpeak ſo, that your Chains may fall off, your Doors fly open, and you be <hi>brought out of darkneſs</hi> and the <hi>Priſon-houſe, Iſa.</hi> 42.7. You need to be ſprinkled with the Blood of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to keep deſtroying Juſtice out: The Blood of the Paſchal Lamb ſprinkled on the Door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> was a Sign to the deſtroying An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel that he was not to break into that Houſe, or kill any there, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.22.23. It is the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt the True Paſchal Lamb, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7.8. that muſt be our Guard, Security, Protection; and where this is ſprinkled, God ſets a Sign on thoſe Souls, that they ſhall not periſh, but eſcape; that they are not <hi>appointed to Wrath,</hi> but <hi>to obtain Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> God ſaith
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:95520:68"/>in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.19. that he would <hi>ſet a Sign among the Jews: Calvin</hi> on the Place, thinks that there is an alluſion to the Blood of the Paſchal Lamb ſprinkled on the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elities</hi> Doors, that was a Sign they ſhould be ſafe: So Chriſts Blood applyed to us, and ſprinkled on us, is a ſure Sign and Token of our Salvation, that we ſhall not come into Condemnation, but find Mercy with the Lord: O therefore apply your ſelves by Faith to Jeſus Chriſt as a Redeemer, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.20. that you may be Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed by the Blood he hath ſhed, by the Price he hath paid; addreſs your ſelves to Jeſus Chriſt as a <hi>Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, Rom.</hi> 11.26. that you may be Reſcued by that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he can put forth. Jeſus Chriſt is a Redeemer by <hi>Price,</hi> and a Deliverer by <hi>Power;</hi> theſe two conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed do render him a Compleat and perfect Saviour. If Jeſus Chriſt be a <hi>refining Fire</hi> to you in this World, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.2, 3, 4. God will not be a <hi>Conſuming Fire</hi> to you in the world to come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. laſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Repent</hi> unfeignedly of, and truly break off from your Sins: <hi>Mark</hi> 1.15. <hi>Repent and believe the Goſpel.</hi> O <hi>waſh</hi> your Hearts from <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> put away the <hi>evil of your doings,</hi> eſcape that <hi>Corruption</hi> that is in the World through Luſt, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.16, 17. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. Break and ſhake off the <hi>bond of Iniquity,</hi> Acts 8.23. Get out of the <hi>Snare of the Devil,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. laſt. and you need not dread the Eternal Priſon. God will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thoſe that bear his Image, live his Life, wage War with his Enemies. As you ſeek to Jeſus Chriſt to quench the Fire of God's Wrath by putting his Blood on it, ſo do you pluck away the Fuel of this Fire by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and continual Mortification; ſuffer in your Fleſh, in your corrupt Nature here, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1. that you may not ſuffer in your Soul for ever hereafter; dye <hi>to</hi> ſin, that you may not dye <hi>for</hi> ſin: If your Luſts do ſtill find Favour with you, how can you hope to find Mercy with God? Curb your Fleſh, reſtrain your ſelves from Carnal Liberty, and you ſhall be ſafe, and ſecured from eternal Bondage. Make a Covenant with your Eyes, <hi>Job</hi> 31.1 reſtrain them from wandring, and gazing on tempting and enticing Objects. Cry to God, <hi>Lord turn away mine Eyes from beholding Vanity,</hi> Pſal.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:95520:69"/>119.37. Keep your Hearts with all diligence, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.23. ſuppreſs vain thoughts that ſpring up; quaſh ſenſual deſires that are ready to ſprout forth: The old man is a ſtock ſtill budding; In-dwelling ſin is ſtill tempting; this Womb would ſtill conceive, and bring forth Fruit to death; there is a <hi>Law</hi> in us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.21. that Satan hath enacted, <hi>Members</hi> that he hath made; <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Luſts</hi> that he hath kindled, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.15, 16. Our daily Work therefore muſt be to contend with our corrupt Wills and vile Affections; to fight againſt ſin, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with and overcome our ſelves: <hi>He that overcometh ſhall not be hurt of the ſecond Death,</hi> Rev. 2.11. You muſt reſtrain your Tongues, and ſet a Watch before the door of your Lips; the Pſalmiſt ſaid, he would <hi>take heed to his ways, that he did not ſin with his Tongue;</hi> he would <hi>keep his Mouth with a Bridle,</hi> Pſal. 39.1. Much ſin would be prevented if we did watch over our Words. Chriſts great ſilence when he was falſly accuſed, points at Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners great ſin in abuſing their Tongues in raſh and evil ſpeaking. We muſt alſo refrain our Feet from the ways of Sin and Death, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.101. <hi>I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy Word. By the Word of thy Lips I have kept my ſelf from the Path of the deſtroyer,</hi> Pſal. 17.4. Wicked men take Liberty to themſelves to ſay or do what they pleaſe: <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.10. They <hi>love to wander, they have not refrained their Feet:</hi> It is dangerous for you to affect a Liberty for your cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Hearts, roving Senſes, and wandring Feet. If you give Liberty to your Luſts, God will <hi>proclaim Liberty</hi> to the <hi>Sword, Jer.</hi> 34.17. Would you have Gods pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing hand at Liberty to deſtroy you? would you have his Gliſtering Sword at Liberty to cut you off? ſhall all banks be cut, and the Flood of the Wrath of God be at Liberty to overwhelm and ſwallow you up for ever? Abridge your ſelves, deny carnal Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to your Fleſh and it's Luſts: If you walk in the Narrow Way of the Law-giver, you ſhall not fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtrait Priſon of the Judge.</p>
